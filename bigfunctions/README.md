# BigFunctions


BigFunctions are open-source BigQuery routines that give you **SQL-superpowers** in BigQuery ğŸ’ª.


!!! note ""

    **âœ… You can call ANY of the following public BigFunctions from your Google Cloud Project** (*no install*).

    - The functions are deployed in `bigfunctions` GCP project in 39 datasets for all of the 39 BigQuery regions.
    - They are public, so they can be called by anyone.
    - For any question or difficulties, please read [Getting Started](../README.md).
    - If you prefer to deploy the BigFunction in your own project, read [Getting Started](../README.md).
    - Found a bug? Please raise an issue [here](https://github.com/unytics/bigfunctions/issues/new/choose)
