  Return the `offset` (zero-based index) of the first `value` in `arr` where `value <= x`
  (or `null` if no `value` is lower than `x`).
arguments:
  - name: arr
    type: any type
  - name: x
    type: any type
output:
  name: offset
  type: int64
examples:
  - description: "When a lower `value` exists in array"
    arguments:
      - "[3, 4]"
      - "3.5"
    output: "0"
  - description: "When a lower `value` does NOT exist in array"
    arguments:
      - "[3, 4]"
      - "1"
    output: "null"
code: |
  (
    select offset
    from unnest(arr) as value
    with offset
    where value <= x
    order by offset
    limit 1
  )
