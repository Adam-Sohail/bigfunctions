**Use Case: Data Validation**

Imagine you have a table containing product information, including a list of associated tags.  You want to validate that the tags associated with a product in one system match the tags in another system.

```sql
SELECT
    product_id,
    bigfunctions.YOUR_REGION.are_arrays_equal(system1_tags, system2_tags) AS tags_match
FROM
    product_data;
```

This query would return a table showing the `product_id` and a boolean value (`tags_match`) indicating whether the tag arrays are identical. You could then filter this table to identify products with mismatched tags.
