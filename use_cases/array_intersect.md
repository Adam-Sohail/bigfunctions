**Use Case: Finding Common Interests**

Imagine you have a dataset of users and their interests, stored as arrays. You want to find users who share at least one common interest with a specific user.

```sql
WITH UserInterests AS (
    SELECT 'user1' AS user_id, ['reading', 'hiking', 'coding'] AS interests UNION ALL
    SELECT 'user2' AS user_id, ['coding', 'gaming', 'music'] AS interests UNION ALL
    SELECT 'user3' AS user_id, ['cooking', 'hiking', 'photography'] AS interests UNION ALL
    SELECT 'user4' AS user_id, ['gaming', 'sports', 'travel'] AS interests
),
TargetUserInterests AS (
    SELECT interests FROM UserInterests WHERE user_id = 'user1'  -- Let's say user1 is our target user
)
SELECT ui.user_id
FROM UserInterests AS ui, TargetUserInterests AS tui
WHERE bigfunctions.YOUR_REGION.array_intersect(ui.interests, tui.interests) IS NOT NULL  -- Replace YOUR_REGION with your BigQuery region
  AND ui.user_id != 'user1'; -- Exclude the target user himself
```

This query uses `array_intersect` to find the intersection of interests between each user and the target user ('user1').  If the intersection is not null (meaning they have at least one common interest), the user_id is returned.  The final `AND` clause ensures the target user isn't included in the results.

**Other Use Cases:**

* **Product Recommendations:**  Find products with features in common with a user's previously purchased items.
* **Skill Matching:** Identify candidates who possess a required set of skills for a job opening.
* **Event Filtering:**  Show events that match a user's selected categories.
* **Data Deduplication:** Detect records with overlapping data points, like lists of keywords or tags.
* **Inventory Management:**  Find items common to multiple warehouses.


The key is that whenever you need to determine shared elements between two arrays, `array_intersect` becomes a valuable tool. Remember to replace `YOUR_REGION` with the appropriate BigQuery region for your project (e.g., `us`, `eu`, `us-central1`).
