The provided documentation describes a BigQuery function `ask_ai` that leverages Google's Generative AI models to answer questions. Here are a few use cases, expanding on the examples provided:

**1. Data Cleaning and Transformation:**

* **Standardizing Country Codes:**  As shown in the example, you can use `ask_ai` to clean up inconsistent country names entered by users.  Imagine a database with a "country" field containing free-text entries like "USA," "United States," "US," "united states of america," etc.  `ask_ai` can be used to convert these variations into a standardized format, such as the three-letter ISO country code.
* **Extracting Information from Unstructured Text:** Suppose you have a column with customer feedback. You could use `ask_ai` to identify and extract key sentiments (positive, negative, neutral), topics discussed, or specific product mentions.
* **Data Validation:**  You could use `ask_ai` to check the validity of data. For example, given a date of birth, you could ask if the person is over 18.

**2. Code Generation (SQL and potentially others):**

* **Generating SQL Queries:** This is a powerful use case demonstrated in the documentation.  Instead of writing complex SQL queries manually, you can describe what you want to achieve in natural language, and `ask_ai` can generate the corresponding SQL.  This is particularly helpful for less experienced SQL users or for quickly prototyping queries.
* **Generating Other Code:**  While not explicitly mentioned, the ability to specify different models like `code-bison` suggests the possibility of generating code in other languages.  This could be explored for tasks like creating Python scripts for data processing or JavaScript code for web applications, directly within BigQuery.

**3. Data Analysis and Insights:**

* **Summarizing Text:** Given a large volume of text data (e.g., customer reviews, news articles), `ask_ai` can provide concise summaries, highlighting key themes and trends.
* **Answering Business Questions:** You could pose questions like "What are the top 3 reasons for customer churn?" or "Which product category has seen the highest growth in the last quarter?" and `ask_ai` could analyze the data and provide answers in natural language.
* **Generating Reports:** By combining the SQL generation capabilities with summarization, you could automate the creation of simple reports based on data in BigQuery.

**4. Content Creation and Enhancement:**

* **Generating Product Descriptions:**  If you have a database of product features, you could use `ask_ai` to generate compelling product descriptions for marketing materials.
* **Creating Personalized Content:**  Based on user data, you could generate personalized recommendations, email messages, or other content.

**Limitations:**

It's important to be aware that large language models like those used by `ask_ai` can sometimes generate incorrect or nonsensical output.  It's crucial to validate the results and use the function judiciously, especially in critical applications.  Furthermore, cost considerations might be relevant depending on usage volume.
