A business analyst wants to understand sales data for 2023, specifically which products generated the most revenue. They have a BigQuery table named `sales` in their project (e.g., `my-project.sales_data.sales`) containing product IDs, revenue figures, and other sales-related information.

Instead of writing a complex SQL query, the analyst uses the `ask_my_data` function like so:

```sql
CALL bigfunctions.us.ask_my_data(
    'Get the 3 products which generated the most revenue in 2023',
    'my-project.sales_data.sales'
);
SELECT * FROM bigfunction_result;
```

This function call takes two arguments:

1. **`'Get the 3 products which generated the most revenue in 2023'`:** The natural language question the analyst wants to ask the data.
2. **`'my-project.sales_data.sales'`:** The fully qualified name of the table the question pertains to. This allows the function to understand the structure of the data and generate the appropriate SQL query.

The `ask_my_data` function then internally translates the natural language question into a SQL query (likely involving aggregation, filtering, and ordering), executes it against the specified table, and stores the results in a temporary table named `bigfunction_result`. The analyst can then retrieve the results by querying `bigfunction_result`.

This simplified approach allows users without extensive SQL knowledge to extract insights from their data using natural language, making data analysis more accessible and efficient.
