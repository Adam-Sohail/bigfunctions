The `chart` BigQuery function generates HTML containing a Chart.js chart.  Here are a few use cases:

* **Quick Data Visualization within BigQuery:**  Imagine you're analyzing sales data in BigQuery.  Instead of exporting the data to another tool for visualization, you can use `chart` to generate a bar chart directly within the BigQuery console. This is useful for quick exploratory data analysis and for sharing insights with colleagues directly in the query results.

* **Automated Reporting:** You could incorporate the `chart` function into a scheduled query that generates regular reports. The output HTML, containing the chart, could then be embedded into an email or a web page. This automates the process of creating visual reports, saving you time and effort.

* **Dashboard Components:** The HTML generated by `chart` can be used as a building block for more complex dashboards.  You could combine multiple charts generated by the function, along with other data and text, to create a comprehensive overview of your data.

* **Data Quality Checks:** You can use `chart` to quickly visualize data distributions or anomalies. For example, you could create a histogram of a particular metric to identify potential outliers or unexpected patterns.

* **Interactive Data Exploration:** While the basic `chart` function generates static charts, the HTML output could be further processed to add interactivity using JavaScript libraries. This could enable users to drill down into the data, filter the chart, or explore different views.

**Concrete Example:**

Let's say you have a table called `website_traffic` with columns `date` and `visits`. You want to visualize the trend of website visits over the last week. You could use the following query:

```sql
SELECT bigfunctions.us.chart(
    ARRAY_AGG(STRUCT(CAST(date AS STRING), visits)),  -- Prepare data for the chart function
    'line',                                         -- Specify chart type
    'Website Visits'                                  -- Y-axis label
)
FROM `your_project.your_dataset.website_traffic`
WHERE date BETWEEN DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 7 DAY) AND CURRENT_DATE()
```

This query would return HTML containing a line chart showing the trend of website visits over the last week, directly in the BigQuery console. You could then use the bookmarklet mentioned in the documentation to render the chart visually.
