Let's say you have a BigQuery table containing customer reviews for a travel agency.  The review text is stored in a column called `review_text`. You want to categorize these reviews into different topics to understand what aspects of your service customers are commenting on most frequently.  You're interested in categories like "booking process," "customer service," "hotel quality," "tour experience," and "pricing."

Here's how you'd use the `classify_text` function:

```sql
SELECT
    review_text,
    bigfunctions.us.classify_text(review_text, "booking process, customer service, hotel quality, tour experience, pricing") AS classification_scores
  FROM
    `your_project.your_dataset.customer_reviews`;
```

This query will process each review in your table. The `classify_text` function will analyze the `review_text` and return an array of structs, each containing a label (one of your specified categories) and a score representing the probability that the review belongs to that category.  The `bigfunctions.us` part should be changed to match your BigQuery region.


**Example Output:**

Let's say a `review_text` is: "The hotel was amazing, but the booking process was a nightmare.  It took hours on the phone."

The `classification_scores` output might look like this:


```json
[
  { "label": "booking process", "score": 0.95 },
  { "label": "customer service", "score": 0.10 },
  { "label": "hotel quality", "score": 0.80 },
  { "label": "tour experience", "score": 0.02 },
  { "label": "pricing", "score": 0.01 }
]
```

This shows a high probability that the review relates to "booking process" and "hotel quality," reflecting the content of the review.


**Further Analysis:**

You can then use these scores in further analysis.  For example, you could:

* **Filter reviews:** Find all reviews highly related to "customer service" by filtering where the "customer service" score is above a certain threshold.
* **Aggregate insights:** Calculate the average score for each category across all reviews to understand which topics are most prevalent in customer feedback.
* **Visualize trends:** Create charts showing the distribution of scores for each category over time.

This allows you to gain valuable insights from your customer reviews and identify areas for improvement in your travel agency's services.
