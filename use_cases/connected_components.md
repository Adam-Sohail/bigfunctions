**Use Case: Social Network Analysis**

Imagine you have a social network platform, and you store user connections (friendships) in a BigQuery table.  Each row in the table represents a connection between two users.

**Table Schema:**

```
Table: social_connections
Columns:
  user1: STRING
  user2: STRING
```

**Data Example:**

```
user1 | user2
-------+-------
alice  | bob
bob    | charlie
david  | eve
eve    | frank
george | 
```

**Goal:**  You want to identify distinct groups of connected users (i.e., friend circles or communities). Users within a group are directly or indirectly connected to each other, while users in different groups have no connection path between them. George is an isolated user with no connections.


**Solution using `connected_components`:**

```sql
-- Call the connected_components function using your dataset's region (e.g., us)
CALL bigfunctions.us.connected_components('your_project.your_dataset.social_connections');

-- Query the resulting table to see the connected components
SELECT * FROM bigfunction_result;
```

**Expected Output:**

```
node_id | connected_component_id
---------+------------------------
alice    | alice                  
bob      | alice                  
charlie  | alice
david    | david
eve      | david
frank    | david
george   | george                 
```

**Interpretation:**

* Users alice, bob, and charlie belong to the same connected component (friend circle).
* Users david, eve, and frank form another connected component.
* George is in his own isolated component because he has no connections in the original `social_connections` table.  Note how self-loops are created, which is necessary for the function to work correctly.  This can be changed to NULL after the call, if desired.

**Further Analysis:**

You can now use the `connected_component_id` to perform further analysis on these groups, such as:

* Calculate the size of each community.
* Analyze the characteristics of users within each community (e.g., demographics, interests).
* Identify influential users within each community.
* Target marketing campaigns to specific communities.


Other Use Cases:

* **Network Infrastructure Analysis:** Identify connected devices in a network.
* **Recommendation Systems:** Recommend products or content based on connected users' preferences.
* **Fraud Detection:** Detect groups of users engaging in suspicious activities.
* **Biological Networks:** Analyze protein-protein interaction networks or gene regulatory networks.  This could reveal functional modules or pathways.


This example clearly demonstrates how the `connected_components` BigQuery function can be applied to a real-world scenario to gain valuable insights from connected data.  Remember to adjust the dataset region in the function call according to where your data is stored.
