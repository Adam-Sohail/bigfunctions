A use case for the `date_sub_isoyear` function would be analyzing year-over-year performance based on ISO week alignment.  Imagine you have sales data and want to compare the sales of a specific ISO week in the current year to the same ISO week in previous years.

**Scenario:**  A retail company wants to compare sales performance of the first week of June 2023 (ISO week 22) to the sales of the same ISO week (week 22) in 2022 and 2021.

**Query Example (using the `europe-west1` dataset):**

```sql
WITH SalesData AS (
    SELECT
        DATE('2021-05-31') AS sale_date, 1200 AS sales_amount UNION ALL  -- Example data for week 22 in 2021
    SELECT
        DATE('2022-05-30') AS sale_date, 1500 AS sales_amount UNION ALL  -- Example data for week 22 in 2022
    SELECT
        DATE('2023-06-05') AS sale_date, 1800 AS sales_amount           -- Example data for week 22 in 2023
)

SELECT
    sd.sale_date,
    sd.sales_amount,
    bigfunctions.europe_west1.date_sub_isoyear(sd.sale_date, 1) AS previous_year_date,  -- Date of the same ISO week in the previous year
    bigfunctions.europe_west1.date_sub_isoyear(sd.sale_date, 2) AS two_years_ago_date    -- Date of the same ISO week two years ago
FROM
    SalesData sd
ORDER BY sd.sale_date;

```

This query would return a table showing the sales for each date, along with the corresponding dates in the previous two years that fall within the same ISO week.  This allows for direct comparison of sales figures across consistent ISO weeks, regardless of calendar date shifts.

**Other potential use cases:**

* **Financial reporting:** Comparing financial performance across ISO years.
* **Marketing analysis:** Tracking campaign effectiveness based on ISO week alignment.
* **Supply chain management:** Analyzing inventory levels and demand based on consistent ISO week patterns.
* **Any time series analysis** where comparison across ISO weeks is more relevant than calendar dates.


By using `date_sub_isoyear`, you ensure that comparisons are made across equivalent time periods in different years, according to the ISO week numbering system, providing a more accurate and meaningful analysis.
