Imagine you have a table of product prices and you want to find the index of the first product in a given list that is priced at or below a certain threshold.

**Scenario:** You're building a price comparison tool.  You have a table with competitor prices for a specific product:

| Competitor | Price |
|---|---|
| A | 12.99 |
| B | 10.50 |
| C | 15.00 |
| D | 9.99 |
| E | 11.75 |


A user sets a maximum price they are willing to pay, say $11.00. You want to quickly find the first competitor in the list offering a price at or below $11.00.

**BigQuery SQL using `find_lower_value`:**

```sql
SELECT find_lower_value([12.99, 10.50, 15.00, 9.99, 11.75], 11.00) AS first_affordable_competitor_index;
```

This query would return `1`, which is the index of competitor B (remember, it's zero-based indexing).

**Other Use Cases:**

* **Inventory Management:** Finding the index of the first bin in a warehouse with stock at or below a reorder point.
* **Data Analysis:** Quickly locating the first data point in a time series that falls below a certain threshold (e.g., first day temperature dropped below freezing).
* **Game Development:** Determining the first item in a sorted list of player scores that is less than or equal to a given score.
* **Algorithm Optimization:**  As part of more complex algorithms like binary search variations, where you need to efficiently find the position of an element or the first element meeting a specific condition within a sorted or partially sorted array.


This function provides a concise and efficient way to perform this type of search within BigQuery without needing to write more complex procedural code.
