A use case for the `generate_sql` function is to quickly generate SQL queries from natural language questions for data analysis.  Imagine a business analyst who isn't proficient in SQL but needs to explore a BigQuery dataset called `my_project.sales_data.transactions`. They could use this function like so:

```sql
CALL bigfunctions.us.generate_sql(
    'What are the top 5 selling products by revenue in Q1 2024?',
    'my_project.sales_data.transactions'
);
SELECT * FROM bigfunction_result;
```

This call would send the question and the fully qualified table name to the `generate_sql` function. The function leverages a generative AI model (likely by internally calling `ask_ai`) to understand the question and the schema of the provided table (`my_project.sales_data.transactions`).  It then returns a generated SQL query in the `bigfunction_result` table. The analyst can then execute the generated SQL to get the desired results without having to write the query themselves.


**Benefits of this approach:**

* **Accessibility:** Enables non-technical users to analyze data using natural language.
* **Speed and Efficiency:**  Quickly generates queries, saving time and effort.
* **Exploration and Prototyping:**  Facilitates quick data exploration and testing different hypotheses.
* **Learning SQL:**  Can be used as a learning tool to understand how natural language questions translate to SQL.

**Other Examples:**

* **Marketing Analyst:** "How many customers made their first purchase in the last month?"
* **Sales Manager:** "What is the average order value for customers in California?"
* **Product Manager:** "Which products have seen the biggest increase in sales this year?"

In each of these cases, the analyst can ask their question in plain English, and the `generate_sql` function takes care of translating it into a functional SQL query.
