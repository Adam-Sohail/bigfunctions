A market research team wants to analyze user sentiment towards a competitor's mobile application. They can use the `get_appstore_reviews` function to retrieve all user reviews for the competitor's app from the Apple App Store.  The team can then perform the following actions:

* **Sentiment Analysis:**  Process the text of the reviews to determine the overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) expressed by users. This can provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the competitor's app as perceived by users.
* **Feature Analysis:** Identify frequently mentioned features or functionalities within the reviews. This helps understand what users like or dislike about the competitor's app and can inform feature development for their own app.
* **Issue Tracking:** Detect recurring complaints or issues reported by users.  This can help the team understand potential problems with the competitor's app and proactively address similar concerns in their own development.
* **Competitive Benchmarking:** Compare user ratings and reviews of the competitor's app with their own to gauge their relative performance and identify areas for improvement.
* **Marketing & Strategy:**  Understand the language and tone used by users in their reviews. This can help craft more effective marketing messages and target specific user needs.

**Example:**  Let's say the competitor's app is "Fitness Tracker X" and its App Store URL is known.  The market research team can use the BigQuery function like this (using the US region as an example):

```sql
SELECT *
FROM bigfunctions.us.get_appstore_reviews('https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fitness-tracker-x/some_app_id')
```

This query will return a table with the reviews and ratings for "Fitness Tracker X." The team can then further process this data for sentiment analysis, feature analysis, etc.  They could also store the results in a BigQuery table for ongoing monitoring of user reviews over time.
