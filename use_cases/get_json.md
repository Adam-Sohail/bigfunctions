A use case for the `get_json` function is enriching data in BigQuery with information from an external API.

**Scenario:** You have a table in BigQuery containing information about GitHub repositories, including their names. You want to enrich this data with details like the number of stars, forks, and open issues for each repository.  The GitHub API provides this information in JSON format.

**Implementation:**

1. **BigQuery Table:** Let's assume your BigQuery table is named `github_repos` and has a column named `repo_name` containing the names of the repositories (e.g., "unytics/bigfunctions").

2. **BigQuery Query using `get_json`:** You can use the following query to fetch data from the GitHub API and extract the desired information:

```sql
SELECT
    repo_name,
    JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(get_json(CONCAT('https://api.github.com/repos/', repo_name), NULL), '$.stargazers_count') AS stars,
    JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(get_json(CONCAT('https://api.github.com/repos/', repo_name), NULL), '$.forks_count') AS forks,
    JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(get_json(CONCAT('https://api.github.com/repos/', repo_name), NULL), '$.open_issues_count') AS open_issues
FROM
    `your-project.your-dataset.github_repos`;
```

**Explanation:**

* `CONCAT('https://api.github.com/repos/', repo_name)` dynamically constructs the URL for each repository's API endpoint.
* `get_json(..., NULL)` fetches the JSON data from the constructed URL. The second argument `NULL` indicates that no custom headers are needed for this request.
* `JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(..., '$.stargazers_count')` extracts the value associated with the key `stargazers_count` from the JSON response. Similarly, we extract `forks_count` and `open_issues_count`.
* Remember to replace  `your-project.your-dataset.github_repos` with the actual path to your BigQuery table and select the correct regional dataset for `bigfunctions` (e.g., `bigfunctions.us`, `bigfunctions.eu`).


**Result:** This query will produce a new table with the original `repo_name` and the newly fetched `stars`, `forks`, and `open_issues` columns.

This example demonstrates how `get_json` can be used to integrate external API data directly into BigQuery for analysis and reporting, avoiding the need for intermediate data extraction and loading steps.  You can adapt this pattern to interact with other APIs that provide JSON data.
