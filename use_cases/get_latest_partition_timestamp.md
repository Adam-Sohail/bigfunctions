Let's say you have a BigQuery table called `my_project.my_dataset.event_logs` that is partitioned by day on a column named `event_date`.  You want to find the date of the most recent events logged in that table. You can use `get_latest_partition_timestamp` for this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM bigfunctions.us.get_latest_partition_timestamp('my_project.my_dataset.event_logs');
SELECT * FROM bigfunction_result; -- To see the result
```

This will return a table with one row and one column, `latest_partition_timestamp`, containing the latest date for which a partition exists.

**Other Use Cases:**

* **Data ingestion pipelines:** Determine if new data has arrived since the last pipeline run.  You can compare the latest partition timestamp with the timestamp of the last processed data.
* **Report generation:** Automatically filter reports to include only the most recent data.  For example, a daily report could use this function to determine the date to filter on.
* **Monitoring:** Track the recency of data in different tables.  Regularly call this function on key tables and alert if the latest partition timestamp is older than expected.
* **Data quality checks:** Verify that partitions are being created as expected. For instance, if you expect daily partitions, you can check if the latest partition timestamp is within the last 24 hours.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Partitioning Column:** The table *must* be partitioned, and the function will return the maximum value of the partitioning column.
* **Data Type:** The partitioning column's data type will determine the returned timestamp format.  If the partitioning column is DATE, the function will return a date.  If it's TIMESTAMP, it will return a timestamp.
* **Empty Partitions:** The function returns the latest partition *regardless* of whether that partition contains data.  An empty partition will still be considered the latest.
* **Region:** Remember to use the correct BigFunctions dataset for your region (e.g., `bigfunctions.us` for US, `bigfunctions.eu` for EU).  See the documentation for the full list of regions.
