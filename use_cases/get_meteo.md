This `get_meteo` function appears to retrieve meteorological data (likely temperature, precipitation, wind, etc.) based on a given latitude, longitude, and date.

Here's a potential use case:

**Analyzing the impact of weather on sales for a retail chain.**

Imagine a retail company with stores across various locations. They want to understand how weather conditions influence daily sales.  They could use this function in the following way:

1. **Data Preparation:**  They have a BigQuery table with daily sales data for each store, including the store's location (latitude and longitude) and the date of the sales.

2. **Enriching Sales Data with Weather:**  They can use the `get_meteo` function within a BigQuery query to add weather information to their sales data.  For example:

```sql
SELECT
    sales.*,
    bigfunctions.us.get_meteo(sales.latitude, sales.longitude, sales.date) AS weather_data
FROM
    `project.dataset.sales_table` AS sales;

```

(Assuming the sales table is in the US region. Adjust the dataset name according to the table's location).

3. **Analysis:** Now they have a combined table with sales and corresponding weather data.  They can analyze this data to identify correlations and patterns. For example:

    * Do rainy days lead to increased sales of umbrellas or indoor games?
    * Does hot weather boost sales of ice cream and cold drinks?
    * Does extreme weather (heavy snow, heat waves) negatively impact overall sales?

4. **Predictive Modeling:** This enriched data can be used to train machine learning models to predict future sales based on weather forecasts.


Other potential use cases:

* **Agriculture:** Analyzing historical weather patterns to optimize planting and harvesting schedules.
* **Real Estate:**  Understanding the climate of different locations for property valuation and development.
* **Tourism:** Providing weather information to tourists planning their trips.
* **Insurance:** Assessing weather-related risks for pricing policies.

Essentially, anytime you need to combine location-based data with historical or current weather information within BigQuery, the `get_meteo` function could be a valuable tool.  The documentation emphasizes its ease of use by being directly callable within BigQuery without needing to deploy it separately.
