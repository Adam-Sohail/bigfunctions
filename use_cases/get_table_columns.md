A use case for the `get_table_columns` function is to programmatically determine the schema of a BigQuery table. This can be useful in various scenarios, including:

* **Data Validation:** Before loading data into a table, you could use this function to verify that the incoming data matches the expected schema. This can prevent errors and ensure data consistency.

* **Dynamic Query Generation:**  You might need to construct SQL queries dynamically based on the columns present in a table. `get_table_columns` allows you to retrieve the column names and data types, which you can then use to build your query string.

* **Data Discovery and Exploration:** When working with unfamiliar datasets, this function can help you quickly understand the structure of a table without manually inspecting it in the BigQuery UI.

* **Schema Migration:**  If you're migrating data between tables or systems, you can use `get_table_columns` to compare the schemas of the source and destination tables and identify any discrepancies.

* **Automated Documentation:**  You can use this function as part of a script to automatically generate documentation about your BigQuery tables, including a list of columns and their data types.

* **Monitoring and Auditing:** Regularly checking the schema of critical tables can help detect any unexpected changes that might indicate data quality issues or unauthorized modifications.

**Example Scenario: Dynamic Query Generation**

Let's say you have a table with a variable number of columns, and you want to write a query that selects only the columns of a specific data type (e.g., INTEGER). You can use `get_table_columns` to achieve this:

```sql
-- Call the function to get the columns of the table 'your_project.your_dataset.your_table'
CALL `bigfunctions.your_region.get_table_columns`('your_project.your_dataset.your_table');

-- Build a dynamic SQL query based on the results
DECLARE query STRING;
SET query = 'SELECT ';

SELECT
    ARRAY_TO_STRING(
        ARRAY_AGG(
            IF(data_type = 'INTEGER', column_name, NULL)
        ),
        ', '
    )
INTO query
FROM bigfunction_result;

SET query = query || ' FROM `your_project.your_dataset.your_table`';

-- Execute the dynamic query
EXECUTE IMMEDIATE query;

```

This code first calls `get_table_columns` to populate the `bigfunction_result` table. Then, it constructs a dynamic SQL query by iterating over the results and including only the INTEGER columns in the SELECT clause. Finally, it executes the generated query.  This approach allows you to adapt your queries to different table schemas without hardcoding column names.  Remember to replace `your_project`, `your_dataset`, `your_table`, and `your_region` with the appropriate values for your environment.
