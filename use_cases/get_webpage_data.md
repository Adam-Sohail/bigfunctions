The provided function `get_webpage_data(prompt, url)` allows you to extract specific data from a webpage using a natural language prompt.  Here are a few use cases:

* **Competitive Analysis:** You could extract pricing information from competitor websites.  For example:

```sql
SELECT bigfunctions.us.get_webpage_data(
    'Extract the price of the "Product X" from the product page.',
    'https://competitorwebsite.com/product-x'
);
```

* **Market Research:** Extract product descriptions and customer reviews from e-commerce sites to understand market trends and customer sentiment:

```sql
SELECT bigfunctions.us.get_webpage_data(
    'Extract all customer reviews and ratings for "Product Y".',
    'https://ecommercewebsite.com/product-y'
);
```

* **Lead Generation:** Extract contact information from business directories or websites:

```sql
SELECT bigfunctions.us.get_webpage_data(
    'Extract the email address and phone number from the contact us page.',
    'https://targetcompany.com/contact-us'
);
```

* **Content Aggregation:** Pull news headlines and summaries from various news websites to create a consolidated news feed:

```sql
SELECT bigfunctions.us.get_webpage_data(
    'Extract the headline and summary of the top 3 news articles on the homepage.',
    'https://newswebsite.com'
);
```

* **Real Estate Data Analysis:** Extract property details like price, square footage, and number of bedrooms from real estate listings:

```sql
SELECT bigfunctions.us.get_webpage_data(
    'Extract the price, square footage, number of bedrooms, and address of the property.',
    'https://realestatewebsite.com/property-listing-123'
);
```

* **Monitoring Website Changes:** Track changes in product availability or pricing on a specific webpage by periodically calling the function with the same prompt and URL.

* **Extracting Data from Tables within Web Pages:** The function can be used to parse HTML tables and extract structured data. For instance, it can extract financial data from tables on a company's investor relations page.


The key advantage is the use of natural language prompts, making it easier to specify what data you need without needing to write complex web scraping code or understand the underlying HTML structure. However, the accuracy and reliability depend heavily on the clarity and specificity of the prompt and the complexity of the target website's structure.  It's essential to test and refine prompts for optimal results.
