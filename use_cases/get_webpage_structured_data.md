A use case for the `get_webpage_structured_data` function is **SEO analysis and monitoring**.

Imagine you have a database of competitor websites or a list of your own web pages. You could use this function within BigQuery to:

1. **Extract structured data at scale:** Periodically run a query that iterates through your list of URLs and calls `get_webpage_structured_data` for each one.  This allows you to collect the structured data for a large number of pages efficiently.

2. **Identify missing or incorrect structured data:** Analyze the returned JSON for specific schema types (e.g., Product, Article, LocalBusiness) to ensure your competitors or your own pages have correctly implemented structured data markup. This helps identify opportunities to improve search engine visibility.

3. **Track changes in structured data:** By running the function regularly, you can monitor changes in structured data implementations over time. This could indicate updates to content, changes in SEO strategy, or technical issues.

4. **Competitive analysis:**  See what structured data your competitors are using.  This can inform your own SEO strategy.  For example, if competitors are using a specific schema type that you aren't, it might be worth investigating.

5. **Automated reporting:** Build dashboards and reports in BigQuery to visualize structured data trends and identify areas for improvement.


**Example Scenario:**

Let's say you want to check if your competitors are using the `Product` schema correctly on their product pages. You have a table called `competitor_products` with a column `product_url`. You can use the `get_webpage_structured_data` function in a query like this:

```sql
SELECT
    competitor_products.product_url,
    bigfunctions.us.get_webpage_structured_data(competitor_products.product_url) AS structured_data
FROM
    `your_project.your_dataset.competitor_products`;
```

This query will return the structured data for each product URL.  You can then further process the JSON within BigQuery to check for the presence and correctness of the `Product` schema, allowing you to identify competitors who are doing a better job with structured data and learn from their implementation.
