A use case for the `gregorian2hijri` function would be for any application or analysis that needs to represent dates in both the Gregorian and Hijri calendars.  Here are a few specific examples:

* **Event Scheduling and Reminders:** An application scheduling events for a predominantly Muslim audience could use this function to display event dates in the Hijri calendar alongside the Gregorian date.  This would be particularly relevant for religious holidays or culturally significant dates.  Reminder systems could also utilize this function to send out reminders based on the Hijri date.

* **Historical Data Analysis:** Researchers studying historical events in regions where the Hijri calendar was prevalent could use this function to convert Gregorian dates in their datasets to Hijri dates. This allows for a more accurate understanding of the timing of events within the historical context.

* **Financial Reporting:** Businesses operating in regions using the Hijri calendar might need to generate reports based on both calendar systems. This function would facilitate the conversion of Gregorian transaction dates to Hijri dates for accurate financial reporting and analysis.

* **Data Warehousing and ETL:**  In a data warehouse setting, having a function like this available simplifies the process of converting Gregorian dates to Hijri dates during the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process. This allows for consistent date representation and facilitates analysis that requires both calendar systems.

* **E-commerce and Localized Applications:**  E-commerce platforms or applications catering to a global audience could use this function to display dates in the user's preferred calendar system.  This improves user experience and facilitates better understanding of delivery dates, promotional periods, etc., especially in regions where the Hijri calendar is commonly used.

* **Genealogical Research:** Individuals researching family history in regions using the Hijri calendar could use this function to convert Gregorian dates on birth certificates, marriage records, or other historical documents to Hijri dates, aiding in the accurate reconstruction of family timelines.


In essence, `gregorian2hijri` bridges the gap between the Gregorian and Hijri calendar systems within BigQuery, enabling a wider range of applications and analyses for data involving dates relevant to both calendars.
