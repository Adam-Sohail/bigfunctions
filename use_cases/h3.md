A use case for the `h3` BigQuery function would be analyzing ride-sharing data.  Imagine you have a table of ride-sharing trips with starting and ending GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude). You want to identify popular pickup and dropoff locations at different levels of granularity.

Here's how you could use the `h3` function:

1. **Convert GPS coordinates to H3 indexes:**  Use the `latLngToCell` function within `h3` to convert each ride's start and end coordinates into H3 indexes at a specific resolution.  The resolution controls the size of the hexagonal grid cells. A higher resolution (e.g., 10) means smaller, more precise cells, while a lower resolution (e.g., 6) means larger, more generalized cells.

   ```sql
   SELECT
       trip_id,
       bigfunctions.<your-region>.h3('latLngToCell', JSON_ARRAY(start_lat, start_lng, 8)) AS start_h3,
       bigfunctions.<your-region>.h3('latLngToCell', JSON_ARRAY(end_lat, end_lng, 8)) AS end_h3
   FROM
       `your_project.your_dataset.rides_table`;
   ```
   Replace `<your-region>` with the appropriate BigQuery region (e.g., `us`, `eu`, `us_central1`).

2. **Aggregate trips by H3 index:** Now you can group the trips by their `start_h3` or `end_h3` indexes to count the number of pickups or dropoffs within each hexagonal grid cell.

   ```sql
   SELECT
       start_h3,
       COUNT(*) AS pickup_count
   FROM (
       SELECT
           bigfunctions.<your-region>.h3('latLngToCell', JSON_ARRAY(start_lat, start_lng, 8)) AS start_h3
       FROM
           `your_project.your_dataset.rides_table`
   )
   GROUP BY
       start_h3
   ORDER BY
       pickup_count DESC;
   ```

3. **Visualize the results:**  You can export the results to a visualization tool like GeoJSON.io or Kepler.gl.  Since H3 indexes represent hexagons, you can easily display them on a map to visualize the density of ride-sharing activity in different areas.  This allows you to identify hotspots, areas with high demand, or areas that might benefit from more drivers.


By using different H3 resolutions, you can analyze ride-sharing patterns at different scales.  For example, a resolution of 8 might be suitable for identifying neighborhoods with high pickup activity, while a resolution of 6 could be used to analyze demand across larger districts or cities.  The `h3` function also provides other functionalities from the H3 library, such as finding neighboring cells (`kRing`), which can be useful for analyzing nearby areas or defining service zones.
