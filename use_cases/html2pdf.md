A use case for the `html2pdf` BigQuery function would be generating personalized PDF invoices or reports directly from BigQuery data.  Imagine you have a table with customer order information, including items purchased, quantities, prices, and customer details. You could use a query to format this data into an HTML invoice template, then use the `html2pdf` function to convert this HTML into a PDF for each customer.

Here's a more concrete example:

**1. Data in BigQuery:**

```
orders table:
| order_id | customer_id | item | quantity | price | customer_name | customer_email |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 123 | Widget A | 2 | 10 | John Doe | john.doe@email.com |
| 1 | 123 | Widget B | 1 | 25 | John Doe | john.doe@email.com |
| 2 | 456 | Widget C | 3 | 15 | Jane Smith | jane.smith@email.com |
```

**2. BigQuery SQL with `html2pdf`:**

```sql
SELECT
    order_id,
    customer_id,
    bigfunctions.us.html2pdf(FORMAT("""
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <head>
          <title>Invoice #%d</title>
        </head>
        <body>
          <h1>Invoice #%d</h1>
          <p>Customer: %s</p>
          <table>
            <tr><th>Item</th><th>Quantity</th><th>Price</th></tr>
            %s
          </table>
          <p>Total: $%d</p>
        </body>
        </html>
    """, order_id, order_id, customer_name, ARRAY_TO_STRING(
        ARRAY_AGG(
            FORMAT("""<tr><td>%s</td><td>%d</td><td>$%d</td></tr>""", item, quantity, price)
        ), ''
    ), SUM(quantity * price))) AS invoice_pdf
FROM
    `your_project.your_dataset.orders`
GROUP BY
    order_id, customer_id, customer_name;
```

**Explanation:**

* The query groups order items by `order_id` and `customer_id`.
* Inside the `FORMAT` function, an HTML invoice template is created. Placeholders like `%d` and `%s` are used for dynamic data.
* `ARRAY_AGG` and `ARRAY_TO_STRING` are used to create the table rows of items in the invoice.
* `SUM(quantity * price)` calculates the total amount.
* Finally, `bigfunctions.us.html2pdf` converts the generated HTML string into a base64 encoded PDF.

**3. Result:**

The query will return a table with `order_id`, `customer_id`, and `invoice_pdf` (base64 encoded PDF) for each order.  You could then use another tool or process to decode the base64 strings and store or send the PDF invoices. This could be part of a scheduled job to automatically generate and email invoices to customers.

**Other Use Cases:**

* Generating personalized reports (e.g., monthly performance reports for clients).
* Creating product catalogs with dynamic pricing and images.
* Generating tickets or certificates with unique codes.
* Creating dynamic presentations based on data.


This function makes it much easier to automate the generation of personalized PDF documents directly from BigQuery, without needing to export data and use external PDF generation libraries.
