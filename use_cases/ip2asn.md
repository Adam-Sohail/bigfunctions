You have a table of web server logs that includes the IP address of each client that made a request.  You want to analyze these logs to understand the geographic distribution of your users at a network level (Autonomous System Number or ASN).  ASNs represent blocks of IP addresses managed by a specific network operator (e.g., an internet service provider or a large organization).

Here's how `ip2asn` could be used:

```sql
SELECT
    request_time,
    client_ip,
    bigfunctions.us.ip2asn(client_ip) AS asn_info
FROM
    `your_project.your_dataset.web_server_logs`;
```

This query would add a new column, `asn_info`, to your log data.  This column would contain a JSON string with information about the ASN associated with the client IP address, including the ASN number (`asn`), domain (`domain`), and name (`name`) of the network.  You could then use this ASN information for various analytical purposes:

* **Geographic analysis:** By aggregating data based on ASN, you can identify which networks (and therefore, potentially which geographic regions) are generating the most traffic to your website.
* **Network performance analysis:** You might observe performance issues related to specific ASNs, which could indicate problems with a particular internet service provider.
* **Security analysis:** Analyzing traffic patterns by ASN can help detect unusual activity that might be indicative of malicious actors operating within a certain network.
* **Marketing and sales:**  Understanding the distribution of your users across different ASNs could inform targeted advertising campaigns.

You could further process the JSON string to extract the individual fields:

```sql
SELECT
    request_time,
    client_ip,
    JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(bigfunctions.us.ip2asn(client_ip), '$.asn') AS asn,
    JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(bigfunctions.us.ip2asn(client_ip), '$.name') AS asn_name
FROM
    `your_project.your_dataset.web_server_logs`;
```

This revised query provides cleaner, separate columns for the ASN and its name, making it easier to use these values in further analysis, like grouping and filtering. Remember to select the correct BigQuery dataset location (e.g. `bigfunctions.eu` for EU region) to match your data's location.
