You have a table of website access logs, including the IP address of each visitor. You want to analyze traffic patterns by continent.  You can use the `ip2continent` function to add a continent code to each log entry:

```sql
#standardSQL
SELECT
    timestamp,
    request_path,
    user_agent,
    ip_address,
    bigfunctions.YOUR_REGION.ip2continent(ip_address) AS continent_code
FROM
    `your_project.your_dataset.your_access_logs_table`;
```

Replace `YOUR_REGION` with the BigQuery region where your `your_access_logs_table` resides (e.g., `us`, `eu`, `us-central1`). This query will add a `continent_code` column to your results, allowing you to then group and aggregate your data by continent:

```sql
#standardSQL
SELECT
    bigfunctions.YOUR_REGION.ip2continent(ip_address) AS continent_code,
    COUNT(*) AS access_count
FROM
    `your_project.your_dataset.your_access_logs_table`
GROUP BY
    continent_code
ORDER BY
    access_count DESC;
```

This will give you a count of accesses from each continent. This is useful for understanding your user base geographically, targeting marketing campaigns, or optimizing content delivery.
