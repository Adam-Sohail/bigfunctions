You have web server logs stored in BigQuery that contain the IP addresses of visitors.  You want to analyze traffic patterns by continent. You can use the `ip2continent_name` function to add a "continent" column to your log data:

```sql
#standardSQL
SELECT
    timestamp,
    request,
    userAgent,
    clientIp,
    bigfunctions.us.ip2continent_name(clientIp) AS continent  -- Assuming your data is in US region
  FROM
    `your_project.your_dataset.your_webserver_logs`;

```

This query adds a `continent` column derived from the `clientIp` column. You can then use this new column for aggregations and reporting:

```sql
#standardSQL
SELECT
    continent,
    COUNT(*) AS visit_count
  FROM (
    SELECT
        bigfunctions.us.ip2continent_name(clientIp) AS continent
      FROM
        `your_project.your_dataset.your_webserver_logs`
  )
  GROUP BY continent
  ORDER BY visit_count DESC;
```

This would give you a breakdown of the number of visits from each continent.  Remember to replace  `your_project.your_dataset.your_webserver_logs` with the actual path to your table and select the appropriate BigQuery region for the function call (e.g., `bigfunctions.eu`, `bigfunctions.asia_northeast1`, etc.) based on your data location.
