A security analyst wants to identify all traffic originating from a specific range of IP addresses.  They have logs containing source IP addresses and want to categorize these logs based on whether the source IP falls within a predefined range. The `ip_range2ip_networks` function can be used to convert the IP range into a list of CIDR blocks.  This list can then be used in a `WHERE` clause with the `IN` operator or a `JOIN` operation to filter or categorize the log data efficiently.

**Example Scenario:**

The security analyst wants to flag all traffic from the IP range 192.168.1.100 to 192.168.1.110.

1. **Convert the IP range to CIDR notation using the function:**

```sql
SELECT bigfunctions.us.ip_range2ip_networks('192.168.1.100', '192.168.1.110');
```

This will return:

```
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ip_networks                                                                     |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| [192.168.1.100/32, 192.168.1.102/31, 192.168.1.104/30, 192.168.1.108/30]       |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

2. **Use the result to filter the logs:**

Let's assume the logs are stored in a table named `traffic_logs` with a column `source_ip`.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM traffic_logs
WHERE source_ip IN (
    SELECT ip
    FROM UNNEST(bigfunctions.us.ip_range2ip_networks('192.168.1.100', '192.168.1.110')) AS ip
);

```

This query effectively filters the `traffic_logs` table to only show entries where the `source_ip` falls within the specified IP range. This allows the analyst to easily isolate and analyze traffic from the range of interest.


This use case demonstrates how `ip_range2ip_networks` simplifies working with IP ranges in BigQuery by converting them into a more manageable and query-friendly CIDR representation. This is especially useful when dealing with large datasets and complex filtering requirements.
