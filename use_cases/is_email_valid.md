A common use case for the `is_email_valid` function would be cleaning or validating customer data in a BigQuery table.

Imagine you have a table of user information, including an email address column. You want to identify and potentially correct or remove invalid email addresses.

**Scenario:**

You have a table named `users` with columns like `user_id`, `name`, and `email`. You want to create a new table containing only users with valid email addresses.

**Query:**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM `your_project.your_dataset.users`
WHERE bigfunctions.your_region.is_email_valid(email);

```

Replace `your_project`, `your_dataset`, and `your_region` with your actual project ID, dataset ID and BigQuery region respectively (like `bigfunctions.eu` if your dataset is in EU multi-region).

This query uses the `is_email_valid` function to filter the `users` table, keeping only rows where the `email` column contains a valid email address according to the function's validation criteria.

**Other Use Cases:**

* **Data Quality Reporting:**  Generate reports on the percentage of valid email addresses in your data. This helps track data quality and identify potential issues.
* **Pre-processing for Marketing Campaigns:** Ensure that your marketing emails are sent only to valid email addresses, reducing bounce rates and improving campaign effectiveness.
* **Form Validation:** Use the function as part of a data pipeline to validate email addresses submitted through online forms before storing them in your database.
* **Lead Scoring:** Assign higher scores to leads with valid email addresses, prioritizing them for sales outreach.


By incorporating the `is_email_valid` function into your BigQuery workflows, you can improve the accuracy and reliability of your data, leading to better decision-making and more effective business processes.
