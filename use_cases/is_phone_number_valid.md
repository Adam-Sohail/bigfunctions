A common use case for the `is_phone_number_valid` function is cleaning and validating customer data. Imagine you have a BigQuery table containing customer information, including a phone number column.  This data might have been collected from various sources and could contain errors, inconsistencies, or improperly formatted numbers.

**Scenario:** You want to identify valid phone numbers in your customer data to improve the accuracy of your marketing campaigns, reduce communication errors, and ensure data quality for analysis.

**Implementation using `is_phone_number_valid`:**

```sql
#standardSQL
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `your_project.your_dataset.cleaned_customer_data` AS
SELECT *
FROM `your_project.your_dataset.customer_data`
WHERE bigfunctions.your_region.is_phone_number_valid(phone_number, json '{"defaultCountry": "US"}'); -- Replace "US" with the appropriate default country if needed.

-- Alternatively, to handle various international numbers without a default country:
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `your_project.your_dataset.cleaned_customer_data_international` AS
SELECT *
FROM `your_project.your_dataset.customer_data`
WHERE bigfunctions.your_region.is_phone_number_valid(phone_number, NULL); --  Handles international numbers starting with "+"

-- Or, to find potentially valid numbers embedded within other text:
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `your_project.your_dataset.potentially_valid_numbers` AS
SELECT *
FROM `your_project.your_dataset.customer_data`
WHERE bigfunctions.your_region.is_phone_number_valid(notes_field, NULL); -- Extract phone numbers from a text field like 'notes'
```

**Explanation:**

* **`your_project.your_dataset.customer_data`**:  Your original table with customer information, including a `phone_number` column (and potentially other text fields that might contain phone numbers).
* **`bigfunctions.your_region.is_phone_number_valid(phone_number, ...)`**: This calls the BigFunction, passing the `phone_number` column and optional parameters.  
    * Using `json '{"defaultCountry": "US"}'` helps validate national numbers without the "+" prefix assuming they are from the US.
    * Using `NULL` as the second argument allows validation of international numbers (starting with "+") and attempts to extract phone numbers embedded in other text. You can further refine this with the `extract` option in the JSON.
* **`WHERE` clause**: Filters the customer data, keeping only rows where the `is_phone_number_valid` function returns `true`.

**Benefits:**

* **Data Quality:** Ensures your customer data contains only valid and consistently formatted phone numbers.
* **Improved Communication:** Reduces errors in SMS marketing, phone calls, and other communication efforts.
* **Accurate Analysis:** Provides reliable data for customer segmentation, targeting, and other analytical tasks.
* **Cost Savings:** Avoids wasted resources on trying to contact invalid or unreachable phone numbers.


This use case demonstrates how `is_phone_number_valid` can be incorporated into a data cleaning workflow to maintain data integrity and improve the overall quality of your customer data in BigQuery.  Remember to replace `"your_project"`, `"your_dataset"`, `"your_region"`, and `"customer_data"` with your actual values.  And adjust the optional parameters of the `is_phone_number_valid` function as needed for your specific data and requirements.
