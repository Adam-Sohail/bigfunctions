A common use case for the `is_public_holiday` function is adjusting business metrics or forecasts based on public holiday occurrences.

**Scenario:** An e-commerce company wants to analyze daily sales data and understand the impact of public holidays on sales performance.

**Implementation using `is_public_holiday`:**

```sql
SELECT
    order_date,
    total_sales,
    bigfunctions.YOUR_REGION.is_public_holiday(order_date, 'US') AS is_public_holiday_us -- Replace YOUR_REGION with your BigQuery region
  FROM
    `your_project.your_dataset.sales_data`
  WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';
```

**Explanation:**

1. The query retrieves `order_date` and `total_sales` from the `sales_data` table.
2. It then uses the `is_public_holiday` function to determine whether each `order_date` falls on a public holiday in the US.  The region for bigfunctions should be replaced with your BigQuery region (e.g. `bigfunctions.us`, `bigfunctions.eu`).
3. The result includes a new column `is_public_holiday_us` indicating whether each date is a public holiday (true/false).

**Further analysis:**

Having this information, the company can:

* **Compare sales:** Compare sales figures on public holidays versus regular days to quantify the impact.  They might see lower sales on some holidays (e.g., Christmas, when stores might be closed) and higher sales on others (e.g., Black Friday).
* **Adjust forecasts:**  Use the historical holiday data to improve sales forecasting accuracy by accounting for the expected impact of upcoming public holidays. For example, they might anticipate increased online sales in the week leading up to a holiday.
* **Identify trends:** Identify any specific product categories or customer segments that are particularly affected by public holidays.
* **Optimize marketing campaigns:** Plan and execute targeted marketing campaigns around public holidays, taking into account predicted sales fluctuations.

This is just one example.  The `is_public_holiday` function can be useful in various other scenarios involving date analysis, such as:

* **Supply chain management:** Predicting potential delays due to public holidays in different countries.
* **Human resources:** Calculating employee working hours, considering public holidays.
* **Financial analysis:**  Understanding market behavior around public holidays.


By integrating the `is_public_holiday` function into BigQuery queries, businesses can gain valuable insights and make more informed decisions based on a better understanding of the influence of public holidays on their operations.
