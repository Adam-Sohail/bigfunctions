A practical use case for the `json2xml` function is converting JSON data stored in BigQuery into an XML format for integration with systems that primarily use XML.

**Scenario:**  You have product data stored in BigQuery in JSON format.  A legacy system or a third-party partner requires product data in XML format for processing or integration.

**Example:**

Imagine your BigQuery table `product_data` has a column `product_info` containing JSON data like this:

```json
{"product_id": "12345", "name": "Awesome Gadget", "price": 99.99, "description": "A really cool gadget."}
```

You can use the `json2xml` function to convert this JSON data to XML within your BigQuery query:

```sql
SELECT bigfunctions.us.json2xml(product_info) AS product_xml
FROM `your_project.your_dataset.product_data`;
```

This query will produce XML output like this:

```xml
<product_info><product_id>12345</product_id><name>Awesome Gadget</name><price>99.99</price><description>A really cool gadget.</description></product_info>
```

You can then export this XML data from BigQuery for use in the target system.

**Other Use Cases:**

* **Data Transformation for API Integration:**  Convert JSON responses from APIs to XML for consumption by services that expect XML.
* **Generating XML Reports:**  Transform JSON data into structured XML reports for specific business needs.
* **Data Migration:** Migrate data stored in JSON format to systems that use XML.
* **Interoperability between Systems:** Facilitate data exchange between systems that use different data formats (JSON and XML).


By using `json2xml` directly within BigQuery, you avoid the need to export the JSON data and process it externally, simplifying the data transformation process and improving efficiency.
