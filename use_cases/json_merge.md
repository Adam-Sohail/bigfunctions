You have a table with customer data split into two JSON string columns, perhaps due to limitations in how the data was initially collected or stored. You want to combine these two JSON strings into a single, unified JSON object for easier querying and analysis.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine a table named `customers` with columns `customer_info_1` and `customer_info_2` containing JSON strings:

```
| customer_id | customer_info_1        | customer_info_2           |
|-------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| 1           | '{"name": "John Doe", "age": 30}' | '{"city": "New York", "country": "USA"}' |
| 2           | '{"name": "Jane Smith", "age": 25}' | '{"city": "London", "country": "UK"}'   |
```

**Query using `json_merge`:**

```sql
SELECT
    customer_id,
    bigfunctions.us.json_merge(customer_info_1, customer_info_2) AS merged_customer_info
FROM
    `your_project.your_dataset.customers`;
```

**Result:**

```
| customer_id | merged_customer_info                                           |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1           | '{"name": "John Doe", "age": 30, "city": "New York", "country": "USA"}' |
| 2           | '{"name": "Jane Smith", "age": 25, "city": "London", "country": "UK"}'   |
```

This now provides a single `merged_customer_info` column containing all customer data in a single JSON object, making it much easier to query using BigQuery's JSON functions.  For example, you could now easily find all customers in the UK with:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM `your_project.your_dataset.customers`
WHERE JSON_VALUE(merged_customer_info, '$.country') = 'UK';
```


This is just one example.  Other uses could include:

* **Combining data from different APIs:** If you're pulling data from multiple APIs that return JSON, `json_merge` can help combine the responses into a single object.
* **Progressive profiling:** You might gather user data in stages, storing each stage in a separate JSON string.  `json_merge` allows you to consolidate this data as it becomes available.
* **Simplifying data storage:** Instead of having multiple JSON columns, you can combine them into one, making your table schema cleaner and easier to manage.


It's important to note how `json_merge` handles conflicts. If both JSON strings have the same key, the value from the *second* JSON string (`json_string2`) will overwrite the value from the first.  This behavior is important to consider when designing your data model.
