Let's imagine you have a BigQuery table storing user activity logs, where each row contains a JSON string representing various actions a user took within a session.  The JSON structure might look like this:

```json
{
  "userId": "12345",
  "sessionId": "abcde",
  "actions": [
    {"type": "pageview", "url": "/home"},
    {"type": "click", "element": "button1"},
    {"type": "form_submit", "data": {"name": "John", "email": "john@example.com"}},
    {"type": "pageview", "url": "/products"},
    {"type": "click", "element": "addtocart"}
  ]
}
```

Here are a few use cases for the `json_query` function with this data:

1. **Extracting all URLs visited during a session:**

```sql
SELECT bigfunctions.YOUR_REGION.json_query(activity_json, 'actions[*].url') AS visited_urls
FROM your_table
WHERE userId = '12345' AND sessionId = 'abcde';
```

This query would return an array like `["/home", "/products"]`.

2. **Finding all "click" actions and the elements clicked:**

```sql
SELECT bigfunctions.YOUR_REGION.json_query(activity_json, 'actions[?type==`click`].element') AS clicked_elements
FROM your_table
WHERE userId = '12345' AND sessionId = 'abcde';
```

This would return `["button1", "addtocart"]`.

3. **Getting the data submitted in a form:**

```sql
SELECT bigfunctions.YOUR_REGION.json_query(activity_json, 'actions[?type==`form_submit`].data') AS form_data
FROM your_table
WHERE userId = '12345' AND sessionId = 'abcde';
```

This would return an array containing a single object: `[{"name": "John", "email": "john@example.com"}]`.  You could further refine this to get specific fields within the `data` object.

4. **Checking if a specific action type occurred:**

```sql
SELECT bigfunctions.YOUR_REGION.json_query(activity_json, 'actions[?type==`purchase`]') IS NOT NULL AS purchased
FROM your_table
WHERE userId = '12345' AND sessionId = 'abcde';
```

This query returns `true` if a "purchase" action exists in the `actions` array and `false` otherwise.

These examples demonstrate the flexibility of `json_query` for extracting and analyzing data from complex JSON structures within BigQuery.  The function's use of JMESPath allows for complex filtering and projections, simplifying tasks that would otherwise require more complicated SQL or User-Defined Functions (UDFs).
