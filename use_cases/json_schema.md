A use case for the `json_schema` function is to dynamically determine the schema of JSON data stored in a BigQuery table without prior knowledge of its structure. This can be particularly helpful in situations like:

* **Data ingestion from diverse sources:** Imagine receiving JSON data from various APIs or partners where the structure might not be consistent or documented thoroughly. `json_schema` can be used to automatically analyze a sample of the incoming data and infer its schema. This information can then be used to create or validate table schemas, ensuring proper data loading.

* **Data exploration and analysis:** When dealing with unfamiliar JSON data, `json_schema` helps quickly understand its structure and the types of information it contains. This is useful for exploratory data analysis and building queries without manually examining the JSON objects.

* **Schema evolution tracking:** By periodically applying `json_schema` to incoming data, you can detect changes in the JSON structure over time. This allows you to adapt your processing pipelines or table schemas as needed, ensuring compatibility and avoiding errors.

* **Data validation:** After inferring the schema, it can be used to validate subsequent JSON data against the expected structure. This can prevent malformed data from being ingested, ensuring data quality.

* **Automated documentation:** The output of `json_schema` can be used to generate documentation for the JSON data, simplifying communication and understanding among different teams or users.


**Example Scenario:**

Let's say you have a BigQuery table containing a `raw_data` column storing JSON strings from different sources.  You can use the following query to get the schema of the JSON data in each row:

```sql
SELECT bigfunctions.us.json_schema(raw_data) AS inferred_schema
FROM your_dataset.your_table;
```

This will return a table where each row contains the inferred schema of the corresponding JSON data in `raw_data`.  You can then further process this output to:

* Identify the common schema across different JSON data.
* Create a new table with the appropriate schema to store the extracted JSON data in a structured format.
* Flag rows with unexpected schemas for further investigation.


By dynamically determining the schema of JSON data using `json_schema`, you can make your data ingestion, analysis, and validation processes more robust and efficient.
