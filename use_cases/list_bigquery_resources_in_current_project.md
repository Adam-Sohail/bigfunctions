A use case for the `list_bigquery_resources_in_current_project` function is to **analyze BigQuery resource usage and identify popular or underutilized data assets within a project.**

Imagine a large organization with numerous datasets, tables, and views in their BigQuery project. They want to understand:

* **Which datasets are most actively used:** This can inform decisions about data retention, access control, and resource allocation.  The `popularity` score, reflecting recent usage by distinct users, highlights heavily used datasets.
* **Identify unused or rarely used tables:** These might be candidates for deletion or archiving to save storage costs and simplify data governance. Low `popularity` scores indicate underutilization.
* **Understand data lineage and dependencies:** The `details` field can reveal relationships between datasets and tables, helping to visualize data flow and assess the impact of potential changes. For example, you could see which tables are referenced by a particular view.
* **Track user activity:** The function can identify users interacting with different BigQuery resources, providing insights into data access patterns and potential security risks.
* **Automate data discovery and documentation:** The output can be used to generate reports or dashboards summarizing key information about BigQuery resources, including descriptions and usage metrics.  This assists in data discovery and documentation efforts.

**Example Scenario:**

A data engineering team needs to optimize their BigQuery costs. They suspect that many tables are no longer being used. By calling `list_bigquery_resources_in_current_project`, they can get a ranked list of tables by popularity.  Tables with a popularity of zero are prime candidates for deletion.  This allows them to reclaim storage space and reduce costs.  Further, they can examine the `details` for the popular tables to ensure appropriate access controls and optimize performance for frequently accessed data.
