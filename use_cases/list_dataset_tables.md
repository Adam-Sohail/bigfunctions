A use case for the `list_dataset_tables` function is to quickly get an overview of the tables within one or more datasets in BigQuery.  This can be useful in several scenarios:

* **Data Discovery/Exploration:** When working with a new project or dataset, you might not know all the tables that exist. `list_dataset_tables` provides a quick way to see what data is available.
* **Auditing/Documentation:**  You can use this function to generate a list of tables for documentation purposes or to audit the contents of your datasets.
* **Automated Processes:**  In scripts or workflows, you could use `list_dataset_tables` to dynamically determine which tables to process based on their presence in a dataset.  For example, you might have a process that iterates over all tables in a dataset and performs some operation (e.g., data validation, backup, etc.).
* **Data Governance:** This function can be used as part of a data governance process to track and manage the tables within your BigQuery environment. You can regularly run the function and compare the results to a known list of approved tables to identify any unauthorized tables.
* **Interactive Analysis:**  When working in the BigQuery console, you might want a quick reminder of the tables available in a dataset without navigating through the UI.  This function can provide that information directly in the query results.


Example in a data pipeline:

Imagine you have a daily data pipeline that aggregates data from several raw tables into a summary table. You could use the `list_dataset_tables` function to automatically determine which raw tables to include in the aggregation process, making the pipeline more flexible and adaptable to changes in the raw data.


```sql
DECLARE raw_dataset_id STRING DEFAULT "your-project.your_raw_dataset";
DECLARE raw_tables ARRAY<STRING>;

SET raw_tables = (
    SELECT ARRAY_AGG(table_name)
    FROM bigfunctions.your_region.list_dataset_tables(raw_dataset_id)
    WHERE STARTS_WITH(table_name, 'raw_data_') -- Filter for relevant tables
);

-- Use the raw_tables array in your aggregation query
SELECT ...
FROM UNNEST(raw_tables) AS table_name
JOIN `your-project.your_raw_dataset`.table_name  -- Dynamically access tables
...
```


This example shows how `list_dataset_tables` can help automate processes by dynamically retrieving a list of tables within a dataset, enhancing the pipeline's flexibility and maintainability.  Replace `your_region` with the appropriate BigQuery region (e.g., `us`, `eu`, `us-central1`). Remember to adjust the table name filtering logic (`STARTS_WITH`) to suit your specific requirements.
