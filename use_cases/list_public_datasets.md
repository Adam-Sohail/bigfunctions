A use case for the `list_public_datasets` BigQuery function is to **dynamically discover and explore the available public datasets in BigQuery**.  This can be useful for several scenarios:

1. **Data Discovery and Exploration:** A data analyst or scientist might want to explore what public datasets are available for research or analysis without manually browsing the BigQuery UI or relying on outdated documentation. This function provides a quick and programmatic way to get a list of all public datasets.

2. **Automated Data Pipelines:**  In an automated data pipeline, you could use this function to check for the existence of a specific public dataset before attempting to query it. This adds robustness to your pipeline, handling cases where a dataset might be temporarily unavailable or renamed.

3. **Building a Data Catalog:** You can use the output of this function to populate a custom data catalog or metadata store. This allows you to maintain an internal index of available public datasets with additional metadata, such as descriptions or tags.

4. **Interactive Data Exploration Tools:**  A web application or interactive notebook could use this function to present users with a list of available public datasets to choose from for analysis.

5. **Training and Education:** In a training environment, this function can be used to quickly demonstrate the breadth of publicly available data in BigQuery, allowing students to explore different datasets.


**Example Scenario:**

Let's say a data analyst wants to build a dashboard showing trends in cryptocurrency prices. They know there are several public datasets related to cryptocurrency, but they're not sure of the exact names or what data is available. They can use the `list_public_datasets` function to get a list of all public datasets. Then, they can filter that list (perhaps using a regular expression) to find datasets related to cryptocurrency and explore their schemas to determine which datasets are suitable for their dashboard.


**Code Example (Illustrative):**

```sql
SELECT dataset_id
FROM UNNEST(bigfunctions.us.list_public_datasets()) AS dataset_id
WHERE REGEXP_CONTAINS(dataset_id, r'cryptocurrency');
```

This query would return all public datasets containing the term "cryptocurrency" in their ID, allowing the analyst to quickly identify relevant datasets.
