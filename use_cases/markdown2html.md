The `markdown2html` function is useful anytime you need to convert text formatted in Markdown to HTML within BigQuery. Here are a few use cases:

* **Generating HTML reports directly from BigQuery:**  Imagine you have data in BigQuery that you want to present in a formatted report. You can use `markdown2html` to create the HTML structure of the report dynamically, including headings, lists, tables, and formatted text, all within your SQL query. The output can then be visualized directly in the BigQuery console (using the bookmarklet method described in the documentation) or exported for use in other applications.

* **Email formatting:** Suppose you are using BigQuery to generate email content.  You can store email templates in Markdown format within a BigQuery table. Then, using `markdown2html`, convert the Markdown to HTML within your query and send the formatted HTML as the body of the email.

* **Dynamic content creation for web applications:** If your web application integrates with BigQuery, you might store content in Markdown format in BigQuery. Using `markdown2html`, you can query the content and convert it to HTML on the fly, reducing the need to store and manage HTML directly. This allows for easier content updates and a more streamlined workflow.

* **Data documentation:** You could use Markdown to document your BigQuery datasets and tables. Using `markdown2html` within a query, you can dynamically generate HTML documentation pages based on the Markdown content, making it easier for users to understand the data.

* **Enriching data exports:**  If you're exporting data from BigQuery for use in another system that requires HTML formatting, you can use `markdown2html` to transform any Markdown fields into HTML before export.


In essence, `markdown2html` bridges the gap between the simplicity of Markdown for writing and editing text, and the richness of HTML for presentation, all within the BigQuery environment.
