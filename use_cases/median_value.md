You have a table of users, and each user has a list of scores they've achieved in a game. You want to find the median score for each user.

```sql
WITH UserScores AS (
    SELECT 'UserA' AS user_id, [85, 92, 78, 95, 88] AS scores UNION ALL
    SELECT 'UserB' AS user_id, [70, 75, 68, 72, 77] AS scores UNION ALL
    SELECT 'UserC' AS user_id, [90, 95, 88, 92] AS scores
)

SELECT user_id, bigfunctions.us.median_value(scores) AS median_score
FROM UserScores;
```

This query uses the `median_value` function to calculate the median score from the `scores` array for each user.  It will return a table like this:

| user_id | median_score |
|---|---|
| UserA | 88 |
| UserB | 75 |
| UserC | 91 |


This is a practical use case where you need to find a representative central value for a set of numbers associated with each row in a table. Other potential use cases include:

* **Sales Analysis:** Finding the median sales amount per customer.
* **Financial Modeling:** Calculating the median value of a portfolio of investments.
* **Sensor Data Analysis:** Determining the median value of readings from a sensor over a period of time.
* **Performance Monitoring:** Calculating the median latency of API calls.

In essence, anytime you have an array of numeric data associated with individual records, and you need to find a typical or central value that is robust to outliers, the `median_value` function becomes very useful.
