You have a table containing date strings in various formats, and you need to standardize them into a consistent DATE type in BigQuery for analysis.  The `parse_date` function can automatically detect and convert these different formats.

**Scenario:**

You're analyzing customer orders, and the `order_date` column contains date values, but they were entered using different formats due to various data sources or input methods:

| order_id | order_date        |
|----------|--------------------|
| 1        | 2023-10-26       |
| 2        | 10/27/2023       |
| 3        | Oct 28, 2023     |
| 4        | 28/10/23         |
| 5        | Fri Oct 29 08:00:00 2023 |


**Query using `parse_date`:**

```sql
SELECT
    order_id,
    bigfunctions.us.parse_date(order_date) AS standardized_order_date
FROM
    your_project.your_dataset.your_table;
```

**(Replace `bigfunctions.us` with the appropriate dataset for your region.)**

**Result:**

| order_id | standardized_order_date |
|----------|--------------------------|
| 1        | 2023-10-26              |
| 2        | 2023-10-27              |
| 3        | 2023-10-28              |
| 4        | 2023-10-28              |
| 5        | 2023-10-29              |


Now all your dates are in a standard `DATE` format, allowing you to perform date-based calculations, filtering, and aggregations consistently without having to manually handle the different formats. For example, you could then easily query for all orders placed in October:

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM
    your_project.your_dataset.your_table
WHERE
    standardized_order_date BETWEEN '2023-10-01' AND '2023-10-31';
```
