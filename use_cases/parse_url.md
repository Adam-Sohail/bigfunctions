You could use the `parse_url` function to analyze website traffic logs stored in BigQuery.  Imagine you have a table with a column named `request_url` containing full URLs of pages visited. You want to understand which parts of your website are most popular, which campaigns (identified through URL parameters) are driving traffic, or which sections are accessed most frequently by users from specific referring domains.

Here's a practical example:

```sql
SELECT
    parsed_url.host,
    parsed_url.path,
    REGEXP_EXTRACT(parsed_url.query, r'utm_campaign=([^&]*)') AS utm_campaign,
    REGEXP_EXTRACT(parsed_url.ref, r'//([^/]*)') AS referring_domain,
    COUNT(*) AS page_views
  FROM
    `your_project.your_dataset.your_table`,
    UNNEST([bigfunctions.your_region.parse_url(request_url)]) AS parsed_url
  GROUP BY 1, 2, 3, 4
  ORDER BY page_views DESC;

```

**Explanation:**

1. **`your_project.your_dataset.your_table`**: Replace this with the actual location of your website traffic log table in BigQuery.
2. **`bigfunctions.your_region.parse_url(request_url)`**: This calls the `parse_url` function (make sure to replace `your_region` with your BigQuery region) on the `request_url` column, breaking it down into its components.  The result is an array containing a struct.
3. **`UNNEST(...) AS parsed_url`**:  This unnests the resulting array so that you can access individual fields of the URL parts struct.
4. **`parsed_url.host`, `parsed_url.path`, etc.**:  These access the individual components of the URL, like host, path, query string, and referring domain.
5. **`REGEXP_EXTRACT(...)`**: These functions extract specific parameters from the query string and referring domain. In this example, it's extracting the `utm_campaign` parameter (often used for tracking marketing campaigns) and the main domain from the referrer.  You can adapt these regular expressions to extract other parameters you're interested in.
6. **`COUNT(*) AS page_views`**: This counts the number of times each combination of host, path, campaign, and referring domain appears, representing the number of page views.
7. **`GROUP BY 1, 2, 3, 4`**: This groups the results by the extracted fields.
8. **`ORDER BY page_views DESC`**: This sorts the results to show the most viewed pages first.

This query gives you valuable insights into user behavior on your website, allowing you to identify popular content, track marketing campaign effectiveness, and understand referral traffic patterns.  You could further refine this by adding filters based on date ranges, user segments, or other criteria relevant to your analysis.
