A customer service department stores customer phone numbers in a BigQuery table.  They want to clean up the data and enrich it with location information. The `phone_number_info` function can be used to accomplish this.


**Use Case Scenario:**

The table `customer_data` contains a column `phone` with various formats of phone numbers, including some with extra characters or missing country codes.

**Example BigQuery SQL:**

```sql
SELECT
    phone,
    bigfunctions.us.phone_number_info(phone, JSON '{"defaultCountry": "US"}') AS phone_info
FROM
    `project_id.dataset_id.customer_data`;
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bigfunctions.us.phone_number_info(phone, JSON '{"defaultCountry": "US"}')`**: This calls the `phone_number_info` function.  
    - We're using the `us` dataset because our project is in the US multi-region.  Choose the appropriate regional or multi-regional dataset for *your* project's location.
    - `phone` is the column containing the phone number string.
    - `JSON '{"defaultCountry": "US"}'` provides the optional `defaultCountry` parameter. This is important for correctly interpreting phone numbers that don't start with a "+" and country code.  It assumes any number without a "+" is a US number.  You would change this to match the expected default country for your data.

2. **`AS phone_info`**: This assigns the output of the function to a new column named `phone_info`. The output is a JSON structure.

**Benefits:**

* **Standardization:**  The function parses and standardizes the phone numbers into a consistent international format (`number` field in the JSON output), even if the original data was messy.
* **Validation:** The `isValid` field in the JSON output indicates whether the phone number is valid according to international standards. This allows for identifying and correcting invalid numbers.
* **Enrichment:** The function provides additional information like `country` and `type` (e.g., mobile, fixed line). This data can be used for segmentation, analytics, and reporting.
* **Data Cleaning:**  You can use the output to filter out invalid numbers:

```sql
SELECT
    phone
FROM
    `project_id.dataset_id.customer_data`,
    UNNEST(bigfunctions.us.phone_number_info(phone, JSON '{"defaultCountry": "US"}')) AS phone_info
WHERE phone_info.isValid = TRUE;
```


This example demonstrates how to use the `phone_number_info` function to clean, validate, and standardize phone number data in BigQuery, enabling better data quality and more insightful analysis.  Remember to adjust the dataset and `defaultCountry` parameter based on your project's location and the characteristics of your data.
