You're evaluating a machine learning model designed to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company.  You have a dataset with customer features and a label indicating whether they churned (1) or not (0).  Your model outputs a churn probability score for each customer.

Here's how you would use the `precision_recall_auc` function in BigQuery to evaluate your model:

```sql
SELECT bigfunctions.YOUR_REGION.precision_recall_auc(
    (
        SELECT
            ARRAY_AGG(
                STRUCT(
                    predicted_churn_probability AS predicted_score,
                    churned AS label
                )
            )
        FROM
            `your_project.your_dataset.customer_churn_predictions`
    )
) AS auc_pr;
```


**Explanation:**

1. **`your_project.your_dataset.customer_churn_predictions`**:  Replace this with the actual location of your BigQuery table containing the predictions. This table should have at least two columns:
    * `predicted_churn_probability`:  The predicted probability of churn (a floating-point number between 0 and 1).
    * `churned`: The ground truth label (1 for churn, 0 for no churn).

2. **`ARRAY_AGG(STRUCT(...))`**: This constructs an array of structs, where each struct contains the predicted score and the true label for a single customer. This is the required input format for the `precision_recall_auc` function.

3. **`bigfunctions.YOUR_REGION.precision_recall_auc`**: Replace `YOUR_REGION` with the appropriate BigQuery region where your data resides (e.g., `us`, `eu`, `us-central1`). This function calculates the area under the precision-recall curve.

4. **`AS auc_pr`**: This assigns the resulting AUC-PR value to a column named `auc_pr`.


**Why use AUC-PR in this case?**

Churn prediction is often an imbalanced classification problem, meaning there are significantly more non-churners than churners.  AUC-PR is a better metric than AUC-ROC for imbalanced datasets because it focuses on the positive class (churners in this case).  A higher AUC-PR indicates a better model at identifying churners, even if they are a small portion of the overall customer base.

By calculating the AUC-PR, you get a single number summarizing your model's performance, making it easier to compare different models or track the performance of a single model over time.
