You're evaluating a binary classification model (e.g., spam detection, fraud detection, disease diagnosis) and want to understand its performance across different thresholds.  The `precision_recall_curve` function helps you analyze the trade-off between precision and recall.

**Use Case: Optimizing a Fraud Detection Model**

Imagine you've trained a model to predict fraudulent transactions.  Each transaction is assigned a score between 0 and 1, representing the model's confidence that the transaction is fraudulent.  You need to choose a threshold above which you flag a transaction as fraudulent.  A higher threshold means higher precision (fewer false positives—legitimate transactions flagged as fraud) but lower recall (more false negatives—fraudulent transactions missed).

Here's how `precision_recall_curve` helps:

1. **Data Preparation:** You have a dataset with the predicted scores from your model and the ground truth labels (whether the transaction was actually fraudulent).  This data is formatted as an array of structs, where each struct contains the `predicted_score` (float64) and the `ground_truth_label` (bool).

2. **Calling the Function:** You use the `precision_recall_curve` function in your BigQuery query, passing in the array of structs:

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM bigfunctions.your_region.precision_recall_curve(
       ARRAY[
           (0.1, false), -- Low score, not fraud
           (0.4, false), -- Low score, not fraud
           (0.35, true), -- Moderate score, fraud
           (0.8, true), -- High score, fraud
           (0.95, false), -- Very high score, surprisingly not fraud (potential outlier?)
           (0.6, true), --  Moderate-high score, fraud
           (0.2, false) -- Low score, not fraud
       ]
   );
   ```

3. **Interpreting the Results:** The function returns a table with `precision` and `recall` columns. Each row represents a different threshold, and the values show the precision and recall achieved at that threshold.  By examining this curve:

   * **Visualization:** You can plot the precision-recall curve (precision on the y-axis, recall on the x-axis) to visualize the trade-off.
   * **Threshold Selection:** You can identify the optimal threshold based on your specific business requirements.  For fraud detection, you might prioritize high recall (catching most fraudulent transactions even if it means more false positives that you can investigate manually) or balance precision and recall based on the costs associated with each type of error.
   * **Model Evaluation:**  The overall shape of the curve tells you about the performance of your model. A curve closer to the top-right corner indicates a better-performing model. You can compare the precision-recall curves of different models to choose the best one.
   * **Identifying Issues:** The example shows a case where a very high score (0.95) was associated with a non-fraudulent transaction.  This could be a sign of an issue with your model or a data anomaly worth investigating. The precision-recall curve, combined with an understanding of your data, helps pinpoint such scenarios.

In essence, the `precision_recall_curve` function provides a powerful tool for evaluating and fine-tuning your binary classification models, enabling you to make informed decisions about selecting the best operating point based on the desired balance between precision and recall.
