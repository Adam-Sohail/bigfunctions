A use case for this `prophet` BigQuery function would be forecasting future sales based on historical sales data. Imagine you have a table in BigQuery called `sales_data` with two columns: `date` (DATE) and `sales` (INTEGER).  You want to predict sales for the next 7 days.

```sql
SELECT bigfunctions.<your-region>.prophet(
    (
        SELECT
            JSON_ARRAY(CAST(date AS STRING), sales)
        FROM
            `your-project.your_dataset.sales_data`
        ORDER BY
            date
    ),
    7
) AS forecasted_sales;

```

Replace `<your-region>` with the appropriate BigQuery region for your dataset (e.g., `us`, `eu`, `us-central1`). This query will:

1. **Prepare the input data:** The subquery selects the date and sales data from your `sales_data` table, converts the date to a string, and uses `JSON_ARRAY` to create an array of [date, sales] pairs for each row. This is the format expected by the `prophet` function. The data is ordered by date, which is crucial for time series forecasting.

2. **Call the prophet function:** The `prophet` function is called with the JSON array of historical data and the number of periods (7 days) to forecast.

3. **Return the forecast:**  The function returns a JSON array containing the forecasted sales for the next 7 days in the same [date, sales] format.  The result is aliased as `forecasted_sales`.

You can then use the forecasted sales data for inventory planning, resource allocation, and other business decisions.


**More advanced example with custom seasonality:**

You can also pass additional parameters to the underlying Prophet model using the `kwargs` argument. For example, to add a weekly seasonality:

```sql
SELECT bigfunctions.<your-region>.prophet(
    (
        SELECT
            JSON_ARRAY(CAST(date AS STRING), sales)
        FROM
            `your-project.your_dataset.sales_data`
        ORDER BY
            date
    ),
    7,
    STRUCT(JSON'{"weekly_seasonality": true}' as kwargs)
) AS forecasted_sales_with_weekly_seasonality;
```

This allows you to customize the model to better fit your specific data and business needs, such as accounting for daily, weekly, or yearly seasonality. Refer to the Prophet documentation for a complete list of available parameters.


This example demonstrates how the `prophet` BigQuery function can be used for practical time series forecasting directly within BigQuery, simplifying the process and leveraging the power of Prophet without needing external libraries or tools.
