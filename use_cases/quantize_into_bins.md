You could use this function to categorize website session durations into bins for analysis.  Let's say you have a table of website session data with a `session_duration_seconds` column. You want to group these sessions into duration categories like "Short (0-30s)", "Medium (31-60s)", "Long (61-180s)", and "Very Long (181s+)".

```sql
SELECT
    user_id,
    bigfunctions.us.quantize_into_bins(session_duration_seconds, [0, 30, 60, 180]) AS session_duration_category
  FROM
    `your_project.your_dataset.your_session_table`
```

This query would add a `session_duration_category` column to your results.  For a session lasting 20 seconds, the category would be "]−∞, 0[", since the lower bound isn't inclusive. For 45 seconds it would be "[30, 60[", for 150 seconds it would be "[60, 180]", and for 200 seconds it would be "]180, +∞[". You can then use this new category for aggregation and reporting, such as:

```sql
SELECT
    session_duration_category,
    COUNT(*) AS num_sessions,
    AVG(pages_viewed) AS avg_pages_viewed
  FROM (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        bigfunctions.us.quantize_into_bins(session_duration_seconds, [0, 30, 60, 180]) AS session_duration_category,
        pages_viewed
      FROM
        `your_project.your_dataset.your_session_table`
  )
  GROUP BY 1
  ORDER BY 1
```

This would give you a summary table showing the number of sessions and average pages viewed for each session duration category.  This allows you to analyze user behavior based on how long they spend on your website.


Other use cases include:

* **Customer Segmentation by Purchase Value:** Categorize customers based on their total spending into different tiers (e.g., low, medium, high spenders).
* **Lead Scoring:** Assign leads to different score ranges based on factors like engagement and demographics.
* **Performance Analysis:** Group employees into performance categories based on metrics like sales or customer satisfaction scores.
* **Data Visualization:** Create histograms or other visualizations where data needs to be binned for clarity.  The output of `quantize_into_bins` can be used directly for grouping in chart creation.
* **Data Preprocessing for Machine Learning:** Binning continuous variables can be a useful preprocessing step for certain machine learning models.


Remember to replace `bigfunctions.us` with the appropriate dataset for your BigQuery region.
