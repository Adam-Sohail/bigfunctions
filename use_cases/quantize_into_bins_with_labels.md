A common use case for the `quantize_into_bins_with_labels` function is assigning letter grades to students based on their numerical scores.

Imagine a grading system where:

* 0-50:  Fail
* 50-60: Wait for result exam
* 60-90: Pass
* 90-100: Pass with mention

You have a table of student scores:

```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE StudentScores AS
SELECT 'Alice' AS student, 75 AS score UNION ALL
SELECT 'Bob', 55 AS score UNION ALL
SELECT 'Charlie', 92 AS score UNION ALL
SELECT 'David', 45 AS score UNION ALL
SELECT 'Eve', 105 AS score;
```

You can use the `quantize_into_bins_with_labels` function to assign letter grades:

```sql
SELECT
    student,
    score,
    bigfunctions.us.quantize_into_bins_with_labels(score, [0, 50, 60, 90, 100], ['Fail', 'Wait for result exam', 'Pass', 'Pass with mention']) AS grade
FROM
    StudentScores;
```

This will return:

```
+---------+------+----------------------+
| student | score | grade                |
+---------+------+----------------------+
| Alice   |   75 | Pass                 |
| Bob     |   55 | Wait for result exam |
| Charlie |   92 | Pass with mention    |
| David   |   45 | Fail                 |
| Eve     |  105 | UNDEFINED_SUP        |
+---------+------+----------------------+
```

This clearly shows which grade each student receives based on their score.  The `UNDEFINED_SUP` for Eve indicates her score is above the defined range.  You could handle this by adding another bin (e.g., 100-110: Exceptional) or by using an n+1 label approach as shown in the documentation example 4.  For example:


```sql
SELECT
    student,
    score,
    bigfunctions.us.quantize_into_bins_with_labels(score, [0, 50, 60, 90, 100], ['Lower than very bad!', 'Fail', 'Wait for result exam', 'Pass', 'Pass with mention', 'Genius!']) AS grade
FROM
    StudentScores;
```


Other use cases could include:

* **Categorizing customer spending:** Assign labels like "Low Spender," "Medium Spender," "High Spender" based on purchase amounts.
* **Classifying product sales:**  Group products into "Low Sales," "Moderate Sales," "High Sales" categories based on units sold.
* **Defining age groups:**  Assign age ranges to individuals like "Child," "Teenager," "Adult," "Senior."
* **Bucketing sensor data:** Categorize sensor readings into different levels (e.g., "Low," "Medium," "High") for easier analysis and alerts.

Essentially, anytime you need to categorize continuous numeric data into discrete labeled bins, `quantize_into_bins_with_labels` can be helpful.
