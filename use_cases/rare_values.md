Let's say you have a dataset of e-commerce transactions and you want to identify potentially fraudulent orders based on unusual shipping addresses.  You could use the `rare_values` function to find addresses that appear infrequently.

**Scenario:**

You have a table `orders` with a column `shipping_city`.  Most orders are shipped to common cities, but fraudulent orders might be shipped to less common locations.

**Query:**

```sql
SELECT
    shipping_city
  FROM
    `your-project.your_dataset.orders`
  WHERE
    shipping_city IN (
      SELECT
          *
        FROM
          UNARRAY(
            bigfunctions.us.rare_values(
              (
                SELECT
                    ARRAY_AGG(shipping_city)
                  FROM
                    `your-project.your_dataset.orders`
              ),
              0.01
            )
          )
    )

```

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT ARRAY_AGG(shipping_city) FROM your-project.your_dataset.orders`**: This subquery aggregates all the `shipping_city` values into a single array.
2. **`bigfunctions.us.rare_values(... , 0.01)`**: This calls the `rare_values` function with the array of cities and a `frequency_threshold` of 0.01. This means any city that appears in less than 1% of the orders will be considered "rare".
3. **`SELECT * FROM UNARRAY(...)`**: This unnests the array of rare values returned by `rare_values` into individual rows.
4. **`WHERE shipping_city IN (...)`**: This filters the original `orders` table to only include rows where the `shipping_city` is present in the list of rare cities.

**Result:**

The query will return a list of `shipping_city` values that are considered rare based on the defined threshold.  You can then further investigate these orders to determine if they are potentially fraudulent.


**Other Use Cases:**

* **Product Anomaly Detection:** Identify rarely purchased products, which could indicate data entry errors, discontinued items, or sudden changes in demand.
* **User Behavior Analysis:** Find users with uncommon activity patterns, which could be a sign of bots or malicious actors.
* **Error Detection in Logs:**  Identify rare error messages in system logs, which might point to new or infrequent bugs.
* **Spam Detection:** Find rare words or phrases used in emails or messages, which could indicate spam or phishing attempts.


By adjusting the `frequency_threshold`, you can fine-tune the sensitivity of the rare value detection to suit your specific needs.
