A use case for the `remove_accents` function is to standardize text data for searching, indexing, or comparison.  For example, if you have a database of customer names with accents and you want to make it easier to search for names regardless of whether the user includes accents in their query, you can use this function.

**Scenario:**

You have a table of customer names in BigQuery, some of which contain accents:

| customer_name |
|---|---|
| José Pérez |
| François Dupont |
| Anna Müller |

You want to be able to search for "Jose Perez" and still find "José Pérez".

**Query:**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM your_table
WHERE bigfunctions.your_region.remove_accents(customer_name) = bigfunctions.your_region.remove_accents('Jose Perez');
```

(Remember to replace `your_region` with the appropriate BigQuery region for your data, e.g., `us`, `eu`, `us-central1`, etc.)

This query will remove accents from both the stored customer names and the search query, allowing you to find matches even if the accents are not typed precisely.

**Other Use Cases:**

* **Data Cleaning:** Removing accents can be a part of a broader data cleaning process to standardize text and remove inconsistencies.
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**  Accents can sometimes interfere with NLP tasks like text classification or sentiment analysis. Removing them can improve the accuracy of these models.
* **Generating slugs or URL-friendly strings:** Accents can be problematic in URLs. Removing them can create cleaner and more readable slugs.
* **Matching data from different sources:** If you're combining data from multiple sources that might have different conventions for accents, removing them can help standardize the data and improve matching accuracy.
