You have a table of user-submitted comments where some users may have accidentally or intentionally added extra spaces within their text. This can affect analysis and presentation.  You want to normalize the comments by removing extra spaces.

**Example Table:**

| comment_id | comment_text                       |
|------------|------------------------------------|
| 1          | "  This is   a  comment  .   "      |
| 2          | "Another    comment."              |
| 3          | "  Yet another       comment.  " |


**Query using `remove_extra_whitespaces`:**

```sql
SELECT
    comment_id,
    bigfunctions.us.remove_extra_whitespaces(comment_text) AS cleaned_comment_text
FROM
    `your_project.your_dataset.your_comments_table`;
```

**Resulting Table:**

| comment_id | cleaned_comment_text     |
|------------|--------------------------|
| 1          | "This is a comment ."    |
| 2          | "Another comment."        |
| 3          | "Yet another comment." |



By using the `remove_extra_whitespaces` function, the extra spaces within the comments are removed, leaving only single spaces between words and removing leading/trailing spaces.  This makes the comments cleaner and easier to analyze, search, and present.  For example, if you were doing sentiment analysis or keyword extraction, removing the extra spaces would improve the accuracy of your results.
