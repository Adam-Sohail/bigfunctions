Let's say you have a dataset of product descriptions that are cluttered with promotional phrases like "Free Shipping!", "Limited Time Offer!", or "New Arrival!".  You want to clean these descriptions to improve text analysis or create a more uniform presentation.

Here's how `remove_strings` could be used:

```sql
SELECT product_id, bigfunctions.us.remove_strings(description, ['Free Shipping!', 'Limited Time Offer!', 'New Arrival!']) AS cleaned_description
FROM product_descriptions;
```

This query would process each row in the `product_descriptions` table.  For each product, the `remove_strings` function would remove any occurrences of "Free Shipping!", "Limited Time Offer!", or "New Arrival!" from the `description` field. The result would be stored in a new column called `cleaned_description`.


**Another example:**  Imagine you have user-generated comments and want to remove common spam words or phrases.

```sql
SELECT comment_id, bigfunctions.us.remove_strings(comment_text, ['[link removed]', 'click here', 'make money fast']) AS cleaned_comment
FROM user_comments;
```

This would remove instances of  "[link removed]", "click here", and "make money fast" from the `comment_text`, resulting in a cleaner `cleaned_comment` field.


In essence,  `remove_strings` is helpful anytime you need to remove a specific set of strings from a larger body of text for cleaning, pre-processing, or standardization purposes.
