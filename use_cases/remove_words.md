A common use case for the `remove_words` function is cleaning text data by removing stop words or unwanted terms.

**Example: Product Review Analysis**

Imagine you have a dataset of product reviews and you want to perform sentiment analysis.  Common words like "a," "the," "and," "is," etc. (stop words) don't contribute much to the sentiment and can even skew the analysis.  You can use `remove_words` to eliminate them:

```sql
SELECT bigfunctions.us.remove_words(review_text, ['a', 'the', 'and', 'is', 'this', 'it', 'to', 'in', 'of', 'for', 'on', 'with', 'at', 'by', 'that', 'from']) AS cleaned_review
FROM `your_project.your_dataset.product_reviews`;
```

This query will process each `review_text` and return a `cleaned_review` with the specified stop words removed.  This cleaned text can then be used for more accurate sentiment analysis or other text processing tasks.

**Other Use Cases:**

* **Data Preprocessing for Machine Learning:** Removing irrelevant or noisy words from text data before feeding it into a machine learning model can improve performance.
* **Spam Filtering:** Identifying and removing common spam words from emails or messages.
* **Content Filtering:** Blocking inappropriate or offensive language from user-generated content.
* **Keyword Extraction:** Removing common words to identify the most important keywords in a piece of text.
* **Search Optimization:** Cleaning search queries by removing unnecessary terms.


By customizing the `words_to_remove` array, you can tailor the `remove_words` function to various text cleaning and preprocessing tasks.
