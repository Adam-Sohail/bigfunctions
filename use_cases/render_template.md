Let's say you have a BigQuery table with customer data, including their name and purchase history. You want to generate personalized email greetings for each customer using a template.

**Table Example:**

| customer_id | customer_name | last_purchase_date |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Alice | 2023-10-26 |
| 2 | Bob | 2023-10-27 |
| 3 | Charlie | 2023-10-28 |


**Template:**

```
Hello {{ customer_name }},

Thank you for your recent purchase on {{ last_purchase_date }}. We appreciate your business!

Sincerely,

The Team
```

**BigQuery SQL using `render_template`:**

```sql
SELECT
    customer_id,
    bigfunctions.us.render_template(
        """
        Hello {{ customer_name }},

        Thank you for your recent purchase on {{ last_purchase_date }}. We appreciate your business!

        Sincerely,

        The Team
        """,
        TO_JSON_STRING(STRUCT(customer_name, last_purchase_date))
    ) AS personalized_email
  FROM
    `your_project.your_dataset.your_customer_table`

```

This query will generate a new column `personalized_email` containing the rendered email greeting for each customer.  The `TO_JSON_STRING` function converts the `STRUCT` of `customer_name` and `last_purchase_date`  into a JSON string which is then used as the context for the template.


**Result:**

| customer_id | personalized_email |
|---|---|
| 1 | Hello Alice,<br><br>Thank you for your recent purchase on 2023-10-26. We appreciate your business!<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>The Team |
| 2 | Hello Bob,<br><br>Thank you for your recent purchase on 2023-10-27. We appreciate your business!<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>The Team |
| 3 | Hello Charlie,<br><br>Thank you for your recent purchase on 2023-10-28. We appreciate your business!<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>The Team |


This demonstrates how `render_template` can be used for dynamic content generation based on data within BigQuery, useful for various applications like personalized emails, custom reports, or dynamic SQL query generation.  You can use more advanced templating features like loops and conditional logic provided by nunjucks.js as well.
