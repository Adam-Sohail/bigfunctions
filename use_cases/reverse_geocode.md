A delivery company has a database of orders with latitude and longitude coordinates of delivery locations.  They want to enrich this data with more detailed address information for reporting, analysis, and customer service purposes.

They can use the `reverse_geocode` function to get the full address details for each delivery location.  For example, if they have a delivery location with latitude 48.86988770000001 and longitude 2.3079341, they can use the following query in BigQuery:

```sql
SELECT order_id, bigfunctions.eu.reverse_geocode(latitude, longitude) AS address_details
FROM `orders_table`
```

This will add a new column `address_details` to the `orders_table` containing the full address information for each order, including the formatted address, address components, place ID, and more. This information can then be used to:

* **Improve reporting:** Generate reports on deliveries by city, postal code, or other administrative area.
* **Enhance analysis:** Analyze delivery patterns and optimize routes based on address details.
* **Improve customer service:** Provide customer service representatives with accurate address information to resolve delivery issues.
* **Data validation:** Verify the accuracy of the provided latitude and longitude coordinates.
* **Geocoding database cleanup:**  Identify and correct inaccurate or incomplete address information in their database.


Another use case could be for a real estate company that wants to analyze property values based on location details derived from latitude/longitude data.  Or, a ride-sharing service might use this function to provide drivers with more detailed pickup/dropoff location information.
