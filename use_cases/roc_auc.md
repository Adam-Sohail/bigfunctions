Let's say you're building a machine learning model in BigQuery to predict customer churn for a subscription service. You've trained your model and it outputs a `predicted_score` between 0 and 1 for each customer, where higher scores indicate a higher probability of churn.  You also have the ground truth labels indicating whether each customer actually churned (`true`) or not (`false`).

You can use the `roc_auc` function to evaluate the performance of your churn prediction model. Here's how:

```sql
SELECT bigfunctions.us.roc_auc(
    (
        SELECT
            ARRAY_AGG(STRUCT(predicted_score, churned))
        FROM `your_project.your_dataset.your_predictions_table`
    )
);
```

* **`your_project.your_dataset.your_predictions_table`**:  This table contains your model's predictions and the actual churn outcomes. It should have at least two columns: `predicted_score` (FLOAT64) and `churned` (BOOL).
* **`ARRAY_AGG(STRUCT(predicted_score, churned))`**: This gathers all the predictions and labels into an array of structs, which is the required input format for the `roc_auc` function.
* **`bigfunctions.us.roc_auc(...)`**: This calls the `roc_auc` function in the `us` region (replace with your appropriate region) with the array of structs.

The query will return a single value representing the ROC AUC. This value will be between 0 and 1.  A higher ROC AUC indicates a better performing model:

* **ROC AUC = 1**: Perfect classifier.
* **ROC AUC = 0.5**:  No better than random guessing.
* **ROC AUC = 0**:  The classifier is always wrong (predicting positive when it's negative, and vice versa).

By calculating the ROC AUC, you can quantify how well your churn prediction model distinguishes between customers who will churn and those who won't. This allows you to compare different models, tune hyperparameters, and ultimately select the best model for deployment.
