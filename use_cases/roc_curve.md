You're evaluating a new machine learning model designed to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company.  You have a dataset with predicted churn probabilities (output of your model) and the actual churn outcomes (true or false) for a set of customers.  You want to assess the performance of your model across different probability thresholds.  The ROC curve is a perfect tool for this.

Here's how you would use the `roc_curve` BigQuery function in this scenario:

```sql
#standardSQL
WITH churn_predictions AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        predicted_churn_probability,
        IF(churned, TRUE, FALSE) AS actual_churned
    FROM
        `your_project.your_dataset.customer_churn_data`
)

SELECT *
FROM bigfunctions.your_region.roc_curve(
    ARRAY_AGG(
        STRUCT(predicted_churn_probability, actual_churned)
    )
) AS roc;

```

**Explanation:**

1. **`churn_predictions` CTE:** This selects the customer ID, the predicted churn probability from your model, and the actual churn outcome.  The `IF` statement converts the `churned` column (presumably an integer or string) into a boolean `TRUE` or `FALSE` as required by the `roc_curve` function.

2. **`ARRAY_AGG`:** This aggregates the predicted probability and actual churn outcome into an array of structs, which is the expected input format for the `roc_curve` function.

3. **`bigfunctions.your_region.roc_curve(...)`:**  This calls the `roc_curve` function with the array of structs. Remember to replace `your_region` with the appropriate BigQuery region (e.g., `us`, `eu`, `us-central1`).

4. **`AS roc`:** This assigns the output of the function to a table alias `roc`.

**Result and Interpretation:**

The query will return a table with two columns: `false_positive_rate` and `true_positive_rate`.  These represent the coordinates of the ROC curve.  By plotting these points, you can visualize the trade-off between the model's sensitivity (true positive rate) and its specificity (1 - false positive rate) at various threshold settings.  A higher area under the ROC curve (AUC) indicates better model performance.


This example demonstrates how `roc_curve` can be practically used to evaluate the performance of a binary classification model in a real-world business scenario. You could then use this information to choose an appropriate threshold for your model based on the desired balance between correctly identifying churned customers and minimizing false alarms.
