The `sankey_chart` function is best used when you want to visualize the flow of something between different stages or categories within BigQuery. Here are some use cases:

* **E-commerce Customer Journey:** Track how users move through different stages of a purchase funnel (e.g., product view, add to cart, checkout, purchase).  The thickness of the flow lines in the Sankey diagram would represent the number of users transitioning between each stage, highlighting bottlenecks or drop-off points.  The input data would consist of tuples representing the source stage, destination stage, and the number of users making that transition.

* **Sales Lead Tracking:** Visualize the progression of leads through your sales pipeline (e.g., lead generation, qualification, proposal, negotiation, closed won/lost). This helps identify stages with low conversion rates and optimize the sales process. The input data would be similar to the e-commerce example, with tuples representing the sales stage transitions and the number of leads.

* **Website User Flow:** Analyze how users navigate through your website, from the landing page to various sections and ultimately to a desired action (e.g., signup, purchase). This allows you to identify popular paths, areas of friction, and optimize website design for better user experience. The input data would represent transitions between website pages and the number of users navigating between them.

* **Supply Chain Management:** Track the flow of goods and materials through different stages of your supply chain.  This helps visualize dependencies, identify potential disruptions, and optimize logistics. Input data would represent movement of goods between locations or stages of production and the quantity of goods.

* **Financial Transactions:** Visualize the flow of money between different accounts or entities. This can be used for fraud detection, financial analysis, or understanding complex financial networks. Input tuples would represent transfers between accounts and the amount transferred.


In each of these scenarios, the `sankey_chart` function takes the structured data from your BigQuery tables and generates an interactive HTML visualization that makes it easy to understand and analyze the flow patterns. The visualization can then be embedded in reports, dashboards, or presentations.
