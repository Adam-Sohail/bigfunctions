This `send_mail` function has several practical use cases within BigQuery:

**1. Data-Driven Alerting:**

Imagine you have a BigQuery script that monitors website traffic.  You could use `send_mail` to send an alert if traffic drops below a certain threshold.

```sql
DECLARE low_traffic_threshold INT64 DEFAULT 1000;
DECLARE current_traffic INT64;

SET current_traffic = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `your_project.your_dataset.website_traffic` WHERE _PARTITIONTIME = CURRENT_DATE());

IF current_traffic < low_traffic_threshold THEN
  SELECT bigfunctions.us.send_mail(
    'admin@yourcompany.com',
    'Low Website Traffic Alert',
    FORMAT('Website traffic dropped to %d today, below the threshold of %d', current_traffic, low_traffic_threshold),
    null,
    null
  );
END IF;
```

**2. Report Generation and Distribution:**

You can generate reports within BigQuery and then email them directly using this function. The example in the documentation shows converting JSON to Excel and attaching it. You could adapt this for CSV reports as well:

```sql
SELECT bigfunctions.us.send_mail(
    'marketing@yourcompany.com',
    'Weekly Sales Report',
    'Please find attached the weekly sales report.',
    'weekly_sales.csv',
    (SELECT STRING_AGG(FORMAT('%t,%t', product_name, sales), '\n') FROM `your_project.your_dataset.sales_data` WHERE _PARTITIONTIME BETWEEN DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 7 DAY) AND CURRENT_DATE())
);
```

**3. Scheduled Notifications:**

Combine `send_mail` with BigQuery's scheduled queries to automate regular email updates.  For example, send a daily summary of key metrics:

```sql
-- Scheduled Query Configuration (set in the BigQuery UI)
-- Destination Table: None
-- Schedule: Daily at 8:00 AM

SELECT bigfunctions.us.send_mail(
    'team@yourcompany.com',
    'Daily Metrics Summary',
    FORMAT("""
        Total users: %d
        Total revenue: %f
        """,
        (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) FROM `your_project.your_dataset.user_activity` WHERE _PARTITIONTIME = CURRENT_DATE()),
        (SELECT SUM(revenue) FROM `your_project.your_dataset.transactions` WHERE _PARTITIONTIME = CURRENT_DATE())
    ),
    null,
    null
);

```

**4. User-Specific Notifications (within a script):**

You could iterate through a result set and send customized emails to different recipients based on data in the table. For example, sending personalized product recommendations:

```sql
DECLARE done BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
DECLARE current_user STRUCT<email STRING, recommended_product STRING>;
DECLARE cur CURSOR FOR
  SELECT user_email, recommended_product
  FROM `your_project.your_dataset.product_recommendations`;

BEGIN
  OPEN cur;
  LOOP
    FETCH cur INTO current_user;
    IF done THEN
      LEAVE;
    END IF;
    SELECT bigfunctions.us.send_mail(
      current_user.email,
      'Personalized Product Recommendation',
      FORMAT('We recommend you check out: %s', current_user.recommended_product),
      null,
      null
    );
  END LOOP;
  CLOSE cur;
END;
```


These are just a few examples. The flexibility of `send_mail` allows it to be integrated into various data processing workflows within BigQuery, enhancing communication and automation. Remember to choose the correct regional dataset for the `bigfunctions` project based on your BigQuery data location.
