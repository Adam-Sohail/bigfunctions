A marketing analyst wants to send a weekly performance report to their team.  They have a BigQuery table called `marketing.weekly_performance` that contains data on ad spend, impressions, clicks, conversions, and other relevant metrics.

**Use Case:**

Using the `send_mail_with_excel` function, the analyst can automate the process of:

1. **Querying the BigQuery table:** The `table_or_view_or_query` parameter can be set to `marketing.weekly_performance`.
2. **Converting the results to an Excel file:** The function automatically handles the conversion of the query results into an Excel file named, for example,  `weekly_report.xlsx`.
3. **Emailing the report:** The analyst can specify recipients (`to`), subject line (`subject`), and email body content (`content`). The Excel file will be attached to the email.

**Example BigQuery SQL:**

```sql
call bigfunctions.<your-region>.send_mail_with_excel(
    'marketing_team@company.com',
    'Weekly Marketing Performance Report',
    '''
    Hello Team,

    Please find attached the weekly marketing performance report.

    Regards,
    Marketing Analyst
    ''',
    'weekly_report.xlsx',
    'marketing.weekly_performance'
);
```


**Benefits:**

* **Automation:** Eliminates the manual steps of querying, exporting to Excel, and emailing.
* **Time-saving:** Frees up the analyst's time for more strategic tasks.
* **Consistency:** Ensures that the report is delivered on time and in a consistent format.
* **Collaboration:** Makes it easy to share the report with the entire marketing team.


**Other potential use cases:**

* **Sales reporting:** Sending daily or weekly sales figures to the sales team.
* **Financial reporting:** Distributing monthly financial statements to stakeholders.
* **Customer support reporting:** Sharing weekly customer support metrics with the customer support team.
* **Automated alerts:** Triggering an email with relevant data when certain thresholds are met (e.g., a sudden drop in website traffic).  This would likely require integrating the function within a scheduled query or other automated workflow.
