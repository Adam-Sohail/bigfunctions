A company wants to analyze customer feedback left on their website. They store the feedback text in a BigQuery table called `customer_feedback`.  They can use the `sentiment_score` function to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of each feedback entry.

```sql
SELECT
    feedback_id,
    feedback_text,
    bigfunctions.us.sentiment_score(feedback_text) AS sentiment_score
  FROM
    `your-project.your_dataset.customer_feedback`
```

This query adds a new column called `sentiment_score` to the table. This score will be a numerical value indicating the sentiment.  A higher score indicates more positive sentiment, while a lower score indicates more negative sentiment.  They can then use this score to:

* **Identify trends:** Track changes in overall customer sentiment over time.
* **Categorize feedback:** Group feedback into positive, negative, and neutral categories for easier analysis.
* **Prioritize responses:** Address negative feedback first to mitigate customer dissatisfaction.
* **Measure campaign effectiveness:**  Analyze sentiment before and after a marketing campaign to gauge its impact.
* **Improve products/services:** Identify areas where customers express negative sentiment and use that information to make improvements.

By applying this function to their existing feedback data, the company can gain valuable insights into customer opinions and make data-driven decisions to improve their business.
