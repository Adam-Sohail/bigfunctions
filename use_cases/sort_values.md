A use case for the `sort_values` function is preparing data for aggregation or other operations where the order of elements within an array matters.

**Scenario:** You have a table storing the daily sales for different products, and you want to find the median sales value for each product over a week.

**Table:**

| product_id | daily_sales |
|---|---|
| 1 | [10, 12, 8, 15, 11, 9, 13] |
| 2 | [5, 7, 6, 8, 4, 9, 10] |
| 3 | [20, 18, 22, 19, 21, 17, 23] |


**Query:**

```sql
SELECT
    product_id,
    (
        SELECT
            CAST(daily_sales[OFFSET(CAST(ARRAY_LENGTH(daily_sales) / 2 AS INT64))] AS BIGNUMERIC)
        FROM
            UNNEST([bigfunctions.YOUR_REGION.sort_values(daily_sales)]) AS daily_sales
    ) AS median_sales
  FROM
    `your_project.your_dataset.your_table`

```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bigfunctions.YOUR_REGION.sort_values(daily_sales)`**: This sorts the `daily_sales` array in ascending order for each product.  Replace `YOUR_REGION` with your BigQuery region (e.g., `us`, `eu`, `us-central1`).
2. **`UNNEST(...) AS daily_sales`**: This unnests the sorted array, creating a separate row for each daily sales value. However, since we're putting it inside a subquery and immediately re-aggregating it, we're using UNNEST here as a trick to access elements of the now-sorted array by index.
3. **`ARRAY_LENGTH(daily_sales) / 2`**: This calculates the middle index of the sorted array.
4. **`daily_sales[OFFSET(CAST(... AS INT64))]`**: This retrieves the element at the calculated middle index, effectively giving you the median value. We cast to INT64 because ARRAY_LENGTH returns an INT64 and OFFSET requires an INT64.
5. **`CAST(... AS BIGNUMERIC)`**:  This is just to handle potential overflow if your sales numbers are very large.  Adjust the data type as needed for your data.

By sorting the array first, you can easily find the median value using the array's middle index.  This wouldn't be reliable with the unsorted data.  Similar logic could be used to calculate other quantiles or perform operations sensitive to the order of elements within the array.
