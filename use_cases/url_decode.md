You have a table in BigQuery that stores URLs, but some of these URLs are URL-encoded (meaning special characters are replaced with percent signs followed by hexadecimal codes). You want to decode these URLs to their original, readable form.

**Example Scenario:**

Let's say you have a table named `website_traffic` with a column called `encoded_url`.  This column contains URL-encoded strings like this:

```
'https%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.com%2Fproducts%3Fid%3D123%26source%3Dgoogle'
```

You can use the `url_decode` function to decode these URLs within a query:

```sql
SELECT url_decode(encoded_url) AS decoded_url
FROM `your_project.your_dataset.website_traffic`;
```

This query would produce a result set with a `decoded_url` column containing the properly decoded URLs:

```
https://www.example.com/products?id=123&source=google
```

**Use Cases:**

* **Log Analysis:** Web server logs often store URLs in a URL-encoded format.  Decoding them makes the logs more human-readable and easier to analyze.
* **Data Cleaning:**  If you have URL data from different sources, some might be encoded and some might not.  Using `url_decode` ensures consistency in your data.
* **Reporting:**  Presenting decoded URLs in reports makes the information clearer and more understandable for stakeholders.
* **Data Integration:** If you're integrating data from a system that provides URL-encoded URLs, you'll need to decode them before storing or processing them in BigQuery.

In essence, whenever you encounter URL-encoded strings in your BigQuery data and need to work with the actual URLs, the `url_decode` function becomes indispensable.
