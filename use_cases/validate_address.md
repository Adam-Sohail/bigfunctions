A practical use case for the `validate_address` function is cleaning and standardizing address data in a customer database.

Imagine you have a large table of customer data in BigQuery, including a column with their addresses.  These addresses might have been entered manually or collected from various sources, leading to inconsistencies like:

* **Different formats:** "123 Main St", "123 Main Street", "123 Main St.", etc.
* **Typos:** "123 Main Sreet", "124 Main St", etc.
* **Missing information:** Some addresses might be missing city, state, or zip code.

You can use the `validate_address` function within a BigQuery query to process these addresses and improve their quality:

```sql
SELECT
    original_address,
    bigfunctions.us.validate_address(original_address).result.address.formattedAddress AS standardized_address,
    bigfunctions.us.validate_address(original_address).result.verdict.validationGranularity AS validation_granularity,
    bigfunctions.us.validate_address(original_address).result.verdict.geocodeGranularity AS geocode_granularity
FROM
    `your_project.your_dataset.your_customer_table`;
```

This query will:

1. **Standardize the format:** The `formattedAddress` field in the function's output will provide a consistent format for all valid addresses.
2. **Correct minor errors:** The function can often correct typos and infer missing information.
3. **Identify invalid addresses:** By checking the `validationGranularity` and `geocodeGranularity`, you can identify addresses that are completely invalid or only partially valid (e.g., only the street is valid).  You can then flag these addresses for manual review or further investigation.

This standardized and validated address data can then be used for various purposes, such as:

* **Geocoding:** Accurately map customer locations for visualizations or analyses.
* **Logistics:** Optimize delivery routes and calculate shipping costs.
* **Marketing:** Target specific geographic areas with advertising campaigns.
* **Data integration:**  Improve the accuracy and consistency of data when integrating with other systems.

By using the `validate_address` function, you can significantly enhance the quality and usability of your customer address data.  This leads to more accurate analyses, improved operational efficiency, and better business decisions.
