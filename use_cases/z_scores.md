A use case for the `z_scores` function is to identify outliers in a dataset.  Let's imagine you have a table of website session durations in seconds:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `your_project.your_dataset.session_durations` AS
SELECT * FROM UNNEST([
    10, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 300, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85
]) AS session_duration;
```

You suspect that the session duration of 300 seconds is an outlier.  You can use `z_scores` to confirm this:


```sql
SELECT
    session_duration,
    bigfunctions.your_region.z_scores(ARRAY_AGG(session_duration) OVER ()) as z_score
  FROM
    `your_project.your_dataset.session_durations`;

```

Replace `your_region` with your BigQuery region (e.g., `us`, `eu`, `us_central1`).

This query will calculate the z-score for each session duration.  The session with a duration of 300 seconds will likely have a z-score significantly higher than other sessions (above 2 or 3, depending on your data distribution), indicating it's an outlier.  You could then filter based on the z-score to identify and potentially remove or further investigate these outlier sessions.


Other use cases include:

* **Standardizing data:**  Transforming data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, useful for comparing variables measured on different scales.
* **Anomaly detection:** Similar to outlier detection, but in a time-series context, identifying unusual fluctuations in metrics.
* **Machine learning preprocessing:**  Many machine learning algorithms benefit from standardized input data.
* **Ranking and scoring:**  Z-scores can provide a relative ranking of items based on their performance compared to the average.  For example, ranking students based on their test scores.


Remember to choose the correct BigQuery region for the `bigfunctions` dataset based on where your data resides.
